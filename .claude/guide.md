# Lenny's Podcast Transcripts to SOPs - Comprehensive Guide

## Project Overview

This project aims to convert 297 podcast transcripts from Lenny's Podcast into actionable, standalone Standard Operating Procedures (SOPs). These transcripts contain interviews with highly successful professionals across product management, growth, leadership, design, engineering, and business strategy domains.

### End Goal
Generate practical SOPs saved individually in markdown files that can be integrated into AI-enhanced projects as ready-to-use guidance for models like Claude, Codex, or Gemini.

## SOP Extraction Methodology

### Step 1: Transcript Analysis Framework

For each transcript, identify:

1. **Core Frameworks/Models**: Named methodologies (e.g., "Jobs to Be Done", "7 Powers", "HEART metrics")
2. **Step-by-Step Processes**: Explicit sequences of actions described
3. **Decision Frameworks**: How to make specific decisions (hiring, prioritization, etc.)
4. **Templates/Artifacts**: Documents, formats, or tools mentioned
5. **Anti-Patterns**: What NOT to do (equally valuable)
6. **Contextual Triggers**: When to apply each insight

### Step 2: SOP Classification

Each extracted SOP should be classified by:

#### Type
- **Process SOP**: Step-by-step procedure (e.g., "How to run a customer interview")
- **Framework SOP**: Mental model or decision framework (e.g., "Evaluating product-market fit")
- **Checklist SOP**: Validation or completion checklist (e.g., "Product launch readiness")
- **Template SOP**: Reusable document format (e.g., "PRD template")

#### Applicability
- **Role**: PM, Designer, Engineer, Founder, Growth Lead, etc.
- **Stage**: Pre-seed, Seed, Series A, Growth, Scale
- **Company Size**: 1-10, 10-50, 50-200, 200-1000, 1000+
- **Industry**: B2B, B2C, Marketplace, SaaS, Consumer, etc.

### Step 3: Extraction Process

```
1. Read transcript completely
2. Highlight actionable insights
3. Identify the expert's unique perspective/framework
4. Extract discrete, actionable procedures
5. Validate each SOP is:
   - Self-contained (can be executed independently)
   - Actionable (has clear steps)
   - Contextual (includes when/where to apply)
   - Attributable (credits the source expert)
```

## Processing Workflow

### Phase 1: Categorization (This Report)
- Categorize all 297 transcripts by domain
- Identify expected SOP yield per transcript
- Prioritize transcripts by actionability

### Phase 2: High-Value Extraction
Focus on transcripts with highest SOP density:
1. Process-heavy interviews (Bob Moesta, April Dunford, Teresa Torres)
2. Framework presentations (Elena Verna, Brian Balfour, Hamilton Helmer)
3. Tactical how-tos (Marty Cagan, Shreyas Doshi)

### Phase 3: Systematic Processing
- Process remaining transcripts by category
- Cross-reference SOPs for consistency
- Build SOP relationship graph

### Phase 4: AI Integration
- Format SOPs for AI consumption
- Create index/routing system
- Test integration with AI models

## Estimated SOP Yield by Transcript Type

| Transcript Type | Expected SOPs | Priority |
|-----------------|---------------|----------|
| Framework/Method Expert (e.g., Bob Moesta, April Dunford) | 5-10 SOPs | High |
| Tactical Practitioner (e.g., Elena Verna, Shreyas Doshi) | 4-8 SOPs | High |
| Founder Story (e.g., Brian Chesky, Drew Houston) | 2-5 SOPs | Medium |
| Leadership/Management (e.g., Claire Hughes Johnson) | 3-6 SOPs | Medium |
| General Discussion/Review | 1-3 SOPs | Lower |

**Estimated Total SOPs**: 800-1,200 across all transcripts

## File Organization

### Rule: All reports and analysis files must be saved into `/docs`

Any generated reports, analysis documents, summaries, or reference materials should be saved to the `/docs` directory, NOT in `.claude` or other locations.

```
/docs
  /reports          # Analysis reports, progress reports
  /summaries        # Transcript summaries, topic summaries
  /references       # Quick reference guides, indexes

/sops
  /product-management
    /discovery
    /roadmapping
    /prioritization
  /growth
    /plg
    /retention
    /activation
  /positioning
  /customer-research
  /leadership
  /engineering
  /sales
  /strategy
  /pricing
  /ai
  /personal-development
  /experimentation
```

## AI Integration Recommendations

### For Claude/Codex/Gemini Integration

1. **Context Matching**: Include clear trigger phrases and scenarios in each SOP
2. **Structured Data**: Use consistent markdown structure for easy parsing
3. **Cross-References**: Build a knowledge graph of related SOPs
4. **Confidence Levels**: Note when SOPs are universally applicable vs. context-dependent
5. **Versioning**: Track source transcript for updates

### Suggested AI Prompt Integration

```
When integrating SOPs, AI models should:
1. Match user context to SOP "When to Use" criteria
2. Check prerequisites before recommending
3. Adapt procedure steps to user's specific situation
4. Flag relevant "Common Pitfalls"
5. Suggest related SOPs for comprehensive guidance
```

---

## Next Steps

1. **Immediate**: Begin processing high-priority framework transcripts
2. **Short-term**: Extract and validate first 50 SOPs
3. **Medium-term**: Complete full extraction
4. **Long-term**: Build AI integration layer and testing
