## Extracted SOPs

### 1. PM Your Career Framework
**File**: `/mnt/d/git_repo/lennys-to-sop-and-skills/sops/leadership/career-as-product-framework-001.md`

**Summary**: A framework for applying product management principles to career development. Addresses the paradox that many great PMs are terrible at managing their own careers - they drift from job to job without intentionality. The SOP guides practitioners to create career specs, roadmaps, metrics, and decision frameworks.

**Key Insights**:
- Write a "career spec" defining your 5-year vision, required skills, and milestones
- Create metrics to track career progress (not just promotions)
- Build a roadmap with stages and required experiences
- Use a decision framework for evaluating opportunities
- Balance learning (stretch roles) and impact (mastery roles)
- The best PMs for products are often the worst PMs for their careers

**When to Use**: Job transitions, annual planning, feeling stuck, comparing multiple opportunities

### 2. Introverts' Workplace Success Framework
**File**: `/mnt/d/git_repo/lennys-to-sop-and-skills/sops/leadership/introverts-workplace-success-framework-001.md`

**Summary**: A dual-approach framework addressing the "secret bias no one talks about" - how workplaces favor extroverts. Provides both individual strategies (reframing self-promotion, treating communication as learnable skill) and systemic changes leaders can implement (bias interrupters, voting systems, round-robin practices).

**Key Insights**:
- Reframe "self-promotion" as "educating your manager about team accomplishments"
- Speaking up is a learnable skill, not personality trait
- "You're making lightbulbs but not marketing the light"
- Leaders should implement bias interrupters: offline voting, round-robin input, async decision processes
- Create processing time for introverts to contribute thoughtfully
- Both individuals must develop skills AND systems must change

**When to Use**: Visibility challenges, promotion cycles, designing inclusive meetings, managing introverted team members

### 3. Building Zero-to-One Products in Large Companies
**File**: `/mnt/d/git_repo/lennys-to-sop-and-skills/sops/leadership/zero-to-one-large-company-framework-001.md`

**Summary**: A framework for successfully launching new products within established companies, based on building multiple billion-dollar businesses at Facebook. Addresses unique challenges: resource scarcity, high scrutiny, 50%+ failure rates. Key insight: "You can love something to death" - excessive attention kills innovation.

**Key Insights**:
- "Zig when others zag" - build where there's less internal competition
- Operate under the radar - freedom to fail is more valuable than abundant resources
- Very high failure rate (~50%) even in successful companies
- Test 5-6+ versions rapidly before finding product-market fit
- "On the verge of death multiple times" is normal
- Keep a backup job while experimenting (Deb ran payments + ads simultaneously)
- Prove value before asking for resources
- Best for mid-career (years 3-7) after learning core skills

**When to Use**: Building new products in large orgs, innovation teams, career decisions about 0-to-1 vs core product

### 4. 30-60-90 Day Onboarding Plan
**File**: `/mnt/d/git_repo/lennys-to-sop-and-skills/sops/leadership/30-60-90-day-onboarding-plan-001.md`

**Summary**: A structured framework for landing well in new roles by prioritizing listening before doing. Three phases: (1) Days 1-30: Learning (listening tour, 30-60 conversations, State of the Union synthesis), (2) Days 31-60: Aligning (shared vision, priorities, team norms), (3) Days 61-90: Executing (deliver quick wins, establish rhythms).

**Key Insights**:
- "Diagnose before you treat" - understand context before acting
- Conduct 30-60 conversations in first 30 days
- Ask "What's one thing I can do to help you this week?" (immediate, small wins)
- Share "State of the Union" summary to demonstrate listening
- Get manager buy-in upfront: "I need 20% time for listening"
- Carve out time explicitly (e.g., 9-10am daily for meetings)
- Deb took extensive notes, remembered someone's wishlist of 5 items, completed all over 2 years

**When to Use**: Starting any new role (IC, manager, executive), internal transfers, inheriting teams

## Additional Insights from Transcript

### Career Principles
- **Always be learning**: "Someone who's always learning will exceed someone who's the expert today"
- **Resilience over pedigree**: The most successful people had failures and learned to bounce back
- **Balance learning and impact**: Alternate between roles you know (impact) and roles that stretch you (learning)
- **Life is 10% what happens, 90% how you react** (Chuck Swindoll quote)

### Product Leadership
- **Fall in love with the problem, not the solution** (Uri Levine reference)
- **Growth is a game of inches**: Not magic bullets, but 1% improvements compounding
- **Portfolio approach**: Some PMs optimize core metrics 5% at a time; others take big swings with 50% failure rate
- **Patient capital**: Innovation needs space to iterate without excessive scrutiny

### Personal Wisdom
- **Most important career decision is who you marry**: Home life balance enables career success
- **Feedback is a gift**: Processing negative feedback as opportunity, not catastrophe
- **Perfectionism is a curse**: Especially for PMs where things will always go wrong
- **Write what you repeat**: If you explain something twice, write it down (Bos's advice)

### Introverts Specifically
- "The workplace really favors people who can speak up"
- Story of brilliant PM who wasn't promoted because she was "bad at broadcasting"
- "I'm a processor - by the time I process, the conversation has moved on"
- Introverts need to learn to speak up AND leaders need to change systems

### Building New Products
- Facebook Marketplace took multiple attempts to convince people
- Mobile ads product tested 5-6 versions before breakthrough
- Deb took her old job back (payments) while keeping ads team alive - bought time for iteration
- "On the verge of death multiple times" before billion-dollar success
