## Files Delivered

### Documentation
- `/docs/sop-index.md` - Complete SOP index with cross-references
- `/docs/project-completion-report.md` - This report
- `/docs/transcript-analysis-report.md` - Initial transcript analysis
- `/docs/guide.md` - Original project methodology

### SOP Files
- 52 individual SOP files in `/sops/` directory
- Organized by domain subdirectories
- Named following convention: `[topic]-[sequence].md`

## AI Integration Readiness
