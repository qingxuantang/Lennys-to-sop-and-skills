# Goal Setter Skill

Help users set effective goals and prioritize their work.

## When This Skill Activates
- "Help me set goals"
- "OKR planning"
- "How do I prioritize?"
- "We keep missing our goals"
- "Quarterly planning"
- "Time management"
- "What should I focus on?"

## Framework Selection Guide

| Situation | Use This Framework |
|-----------|-------------------|
| Setting quarterly/annual goals | NCT Framework |
| Prioritizing product initiatives | GEM Framework |
| Managing personal time | LNO Framework |

## Framework 1: NCT Goal Setting (Frontier of Understanding)

**Source**: Ravi Mehta - Lenny's Podcast
**Key Insight**: Your goal type should match your "frontier of understanding"—where your knowledge ends and uncertainty begins.

### The Problem with Always-Outcome Goals
Standard: "Improve retention by 10%"

What happens:
- Team brainstorms experiments
- Throws spaghetti at wall
- No understanding of why things work
- Can't repeat success

**Better**: Match goal type to what you actually know.

### The Four Risk Types

**1. Understanding Risk**
You don't know what moves the metric.

Signs:
- "We can brainstorm 10 experiments"
- "We don't know why people retain"

Right goal: Learning goal
- "Identify top 3 retention drivers"
- "Form validated hypothesis"

**2. Dependency Risk**
You have hypothesis but lack tools/resources.

Signs:
- "We think X affects retention"
- "But we can't measure X"

Right goal: Capability goal
- "Build retention tracking dashboard"
- "Implement event tracking"

**3. Execution Risk**
You have hypothesis and tools, but haven't proven execution.

Signs:
- "We know what to build"
- "We haven't shipped this type of thing before"

Right goal: Output goal
- "Run 20 experiments this quarter"
- "Ship three retention features"

**4. Strategic Risk**
You have everything but hypothesis might be wrong.

Signs:
- "We believe X drives retention"
- "We can execute on X"
- "But haven't proven X → retention"

Right goal: Outcome goal
- "Improve retention 10%"

### Finding Your Frontier

Ask these questions in order. Stop at first "No":

| Question | If No → |
|----------|---------|
| Do we know what levers affect this? | Understanding risk |
| Do we have tools to act on levers? | Dependency risk |
| Can we execute experiments/features? | Execution risk |
| Is our hypothesis likely correct? | Strategic risk |

### Goal Progression

Typical quarterly progression:
- Q1: Understanding goal → Learn levers
- Q2: Dependency goal → Build tools
- Q3: Execution goal → Prove capability
- Q4: Outcome goal → Drive results

**Key**: This isn't slower—it's more reliable.

### The 2x2 for Reflection

|  | Know Why | Don't Know Why |
|--|----------|----------------|
| **Hit Goal** | Ideal ✓ | Lucky (temporary) |
| **Missed Goal** | Learning | Lost |

Goal: Upper-left (hit AND know why)
Warning: Upper-right (hit but don't know why = can't repeat)

### Communicating Frontier Position

Template:
> "We want to improve [metric]. Currently, we're at [frontier position]. Our goal this quarter is [appropriate goal], which moves us toward outcome goals next quarter."

### Pitfalls to Avoid
- Always setting outcome goals (regardless of understanding)
- Not progressing the frontier (stuck at "learning")
- Hiding behind uncertainty (not pushing toward outcomes)
- Not communicating frontier position to leadership

## Framework 2: GEM Prioritization

**Source**: Gibson Biddle - Lenny's Podcast
**Key Insight**: Score initiatives on Growth, Engagement, and Monetization to prioritize objectively.

### The GEM Dimensions

**G - Growth**
Does this help acquire new users?
- New user sign-ups
- Activation rate
- Expansion into new segments

**E - Engagement**
Does this increase usage/retention?
- DAU/MAU
- Session frequency
- Feature adoption
- Retention curves

**M - Monetization**
Does this improve revenue/economics?
- Conversion rate
- ARPU
- LTV
- Margin

### Scoring System

Rate each initiative 0-10 on G, E, M:

| Initiative | Growth | Engagement | Monetization | Total |
|------------|--------|------------|--------------|-------|
| Feature A | 7 | 8 | 3 | 18 |
| Feature B | 2 | 9 | 6 | 17 |
| Feature C | 8 | 4 | 8 | 20 |

### Weighting by Company Stage

| Stage | Growth | Engagement | Monetization |
|-------|--------|------------|--------------|
| Early | 50% | 40% | 10% |
| Growth | 30% | 40% | 30% |
| Mature | 20% | 30% | 50% |

### Using GEM for Trade-offs

When debating priorities:
1. Score each option on G, E, M
2. Apply stage-appropriate weights
3. Compare totals
4. Discuss surprising scores

### Beyond Total Score

Also consider:
- Strategic alignment (does it fit vision?)
- Effort required (ROI, not just return)
- Dependencies and sequencing
- Learning value

### Pitfalls to Avoid
- Ignoring one dimension entirely
- Wrong weights for company stage
- Not considering effort
- Using scores to avoid hard conversations

## Framework 3: LNO Time Management

**Source**: Shreyas Doshi - Lenny's Podcast
**Key Insight**: Categorize tasks as Lead, Neutral, or Offload—then invest time accordingly.

### The Three Categories

**L - Lead Tasks** (Do Excellently)
- Highest leverage activities
- Require your unique skills
- Failure here = major impact
- Examples: Key presentations, critical decisions, strategy work

**N - Neutral Tasks** (Do Adequately)
- Must be done but doesn't need excellence
- Good enough is good enough
- Diminishing returns on extra effort
- Examples: Routine meetings, standard processes

**O - Offload Tasks** (Delegate/Eliminate)
- Someone else can do it
- Doesn't need to be done at all
- Low leverage use of your time
- Examples: Scheduling, routine reports, tasks others can own

### The Key Insight

Most PMs treat everything as Lead tasks:
- Spend hours perfecting routine documents
- Over-prepare for low-stakes meetings
- Do tasks they should delegate

Result: No time/energy for actual Lead tasks

### Applying LNO

**Step 1: List Your Tasks**
Everything on your plate this week

**Step 2: Categorize Each**
| Task | Category | Why |
|------|----------|-----|
| Board deck | L | High visibility, critical narrative |
| Weekly sync | N | Routine, adequate is fine |
| Expense reports | O | Someone else can do |

**Step 3: Invest Time Accordingly**
- L tasks: Give them your best hours, full attention
- N tasks: Time-box, don't over-engineer
- O tasks: Delegate, automate, or eliminate

**Step 4: Protect Lead Task Time**
- Schedule L tasks during peak energy
- Batch N tasks together
- Systematically offload O tasks

### Common L/N/O Splits

**Healthy PM week:**
- Lead: 30-40%
- Neutral: 40-50%
- Offload: 10-20%

**Unhealthy PM week:**
- Lead: 10%
- Neutral: 70%
- Offload: 20% (but you're doing them)

### Identifying Lead Tasks

Ask:
- What would have outsized impact if done excellently?
- What requires my unique perspective/skills?
- What, if done poorly, would cause significant problems?
- What advances my highest priorities?

### Pitfalls to Avoid
- Treating everything as Lead
- Offload guilt (it's not laziness, it's leverage)
- Not protecting Lead task time
- Doing Neutral tasks at Lead quality
- Not actually offloading Offload tasks

## How to Apply This Skill

1. **Identify the goal-setting challenge**
   - Setting goals → NCT Framework (match goal to understanding)
   - Prioritizing initiatives → GEM (score systematically)
   - Managing time → LNO (categorize and invest accordingly)

2. **Walk through the relevant framework** with specific examples

3. **Help create concrete output**
   - NCT: Identify frontier, set appropriate goal type
   - GEM: Score current options, identify winner
   - LNO: Categorize this week's tasks, create plan

4. **Follow up on progress**

## Combining Frameworks

**NCT + GEM**: Use NCT to set appropriate goal type, then use GEM to prioritize initiatives toward that goal.

**GEM + LNO**: Use GEM to prioritize product work, use LNO to protect time for high-GEM initiatives.
