## Framework 1: Adjacent User Theory

**Source**: Bangaly Kaba - Lenny's Podcast
**Key Insight**: Your current users are not your next users. Growth comes from understanding users just outside your current base.

### What is an Adjacent User?
- Just outside your current user base
- Has the need your product serves
- Tried or considered your product
- Something prevented adoption/retention

### Why Power Users Blind You
When you dogfood as a power user:
- Your history informs your experience
- Algorithms optimized for you
- Features are familiar
- You've learned workarounds

> "If you create a new Gmail account and look at YouTube today, I guarantee it's a completely different and significantly worse experience."

### Signs Your Adjacent User is Different
- Cohort retention curves declining
- Same product, worse metrics for new users
- New market metrics lag established markets

### Adjacent User Process

**Step 1: Map Adjacent User Segments**
| Dimension | Current User | Adjacent User |
|-----------|--------------|---------------|
| Sophistication | Expert | Beginner |
| Geography | US/EU | Emerging markets |
| Use case | Primary | Secondary |
| Device | Latest phone | Older phone |

**Step 2: Experience Product as Adjacent User**
- Create a brand new account
- Use different device
- Don't use power-user knowledge
- Document every friction point

**Step 3: Research Adjacent Users**
- Interview churned/bounced users
- Survey people who didn't convert
- Do on-the-ground research in new markets

**Step 4: Map the Gaps**
| Current Need | Adjacent Need | Product Gap |
|--------------|---------------|-------------|
| Find friends who use app | Find anyone they know | Graph is celebrity-heavy |

**Step 5: Prioritize Fixes**
- Size of adjacent segment
- Severity of friction
- Feasibility of fix

### Instagram Case Study
**Problem**: Users retained well initially, then left at 7-9 months.
**Discovery**: Algorithm prioritized celebrities. Users followed celebs but had no friends. First post → no engagement → left.
**Fix**: Prioritize friend connections in onboarding.
**Result**: Retention doubled in 18 months.

### Pitfalls to Avoid
- Optimizing only for power users
- Assuming adjacent users are similar
- One-time research (needs to be ongoing)
- Not experiencing product firsthand

## Framework 2: Understand Work Framework

**Source**: Bangaly Kaba - Lenny's Podcast
**Key Insight**: Most teams follow identify-justify-execute. Should be understand-identify-execute.

### The Anti-Pattern
1. Someone says "We should build X"
2. Team pulls data to justify X
3. Months building X
4. X launches → metrics flat
5. No learning captured

### The Right Pattern
1. Do understand work first
2. Insights reveal what matters
3. Identify opportunities from understanding
4. Execute with higher conviction

### Calibrate the Ratio
| Team State | Understand | Execute |
|------------|------------|---------|
| New to problem | 40-60% | 40-60% |
| Some understanding | 20-30% | 70-80% |
| Deep understanding | 10-20% | 80-90% |

### Types of Understand Work

**Engineering**: Instrument logging, architecture review
**Data Science**: Funnel analysis, cohort studies
**PM**: User research synthesis, competitive analysis
**Design**: UX audit, user journey mapping

### Making Understand Work Explicit

**Step 1: Put on Roadmap**
Understand work is explicit work items, not "background"

**Step 2: Assign Owners**
Like any other project

**Step 3: Run in Parallel**
```
Each Sprint:
├── Execution Work (things we're confident about)
└── Understand Work (things we need to learn)
```

**Step 4: Empower Push-Back**
When someone says "build X", team asks:
"What do we understand about this?"

### Expected Results
- Higher experiment win rates (60-70% vs typical 20-30%)
- Faster long-term velocity
- Better prioritization

### Pitfalls to Avoid
- Treating understand work as optional
- All understand, no execute
- Not documenting learnings
- Same ratio forever (should shift)

## Framework 3: Kindle Fire Strategy

**Source**: Casey Winters - Lenny's Podcast
**Key Insight**: Use non-scalable "kindle" tactics to ignite scalable "fire" growth loops.

### The Concept
- **Kindle**: Non-scalable tactics to start growth (partnerships, manual outreach, PR)
- **Fire**: Scalable loops that sustain growth (viral, SEO, paid)

### Why Kindle Matters
- Scalable loops need initial fuel
- Early users seed network effects
- Content/data needed for algorithms
- Learning what resonates

### Common Kindle Tactics
| Tactic | Best For |
|--------|----------|
| Partnerships | B2B, platforms |
| PR/Press | Consumer launches |
| Manual outreach | Marketplaces |
| Events | Community products |
| Influencers | Consumer social |
| Content creation | SEO-driven products |

### Common Fire Loops
| Loop | Characteristics |
|------|-----------------|
| Viral/Referral | User invites drive growth |
| SEO | Content ranks, drives traffic |
| Paid acquisition | Profitable CAC/LTV |
| Network effects | Product improves with users |

### Building Kindle → Fire

**Step 1: Identify Target Fire Loop**
What scalable loop will ultimately drive growth?

**Step 2: Work Backward to Kindle**
What non-scalable actions would ignite that loop?

**Step 3: Execute Kindle Intensively**
Go deep, not broad. Manual, unscalable effort.

**Step 4: Measure Fire Ignition**
Is the loop starting to work on its own?

**Step 5: Shift Resources to Fire**
As loop takes hold, move from kindle to fire

### Example: Pinterest
**Kindle**: Invited craft bloggers manually, seeded content
**Fire**: SEO (pins rank), viral (sharing), recommendation loop

### Pitfalls to Avoid
- Trying to scale before loop works
- Skipping kindle (loops need fuel)
- Wrong kindle for the fire you want
- Staying in kindle mode too long

## Framework 4: Distribution Platform Cycle

**Source**: Brian Balfour - Lenny's Podcast
**Key Insight**: Every platform goes through cycles from open to closed. The window to build moat is limited.

### The Four Steps

**Step 0: Conditions for Opening**
- Platform saturated easy growth
- Needs new value creation
- Competitive pressure
- Technology shift

**Step 1: Platform Opens**
- New features/APIs available
- Early adopters get outsized reach
- Moats can be established quickly
- Window: typically 12-24 months

**Step 2: Platform Matures**
- Algorithm favors platform goals
- Organic reach declines
- Pay-to-play increases
- Competition increases

**Step 3: Platform Closes/Resets**
- Commoditized (compete on efficiency)
- Closed (diversify or exit)
- Reset (new cycle begins)

### Moat Types During Opening
| Moat | Description |
|------|-------------|
| Content | First valuable content |
| Audience | First-mover followers |
| Data | Proprietary insights |
| Relationships | Platform partnerships |
| Brand | Category ownership |

### Platform Evaluation

**Step 1: Assess Cycle Stage**
Where is this platform in its cycle?

**Step 2: Evaluate Moat Potential**
Can you build something defensible?

**Step 3: Timeline Check**
How long until window closes?

**Step 4: Decision**
| Fit + Early + Moat Potential | → | Invest heavily |
| Fit + Late + No Moat | → | Test but don't bet |
| Low Fit | → | Skip |

### Preparing for Maturation
- Capture first-party data (emails, etc.)
- Build owned channels
- Diversify acquisition mix
- Develop paid efficiency early

> "The best time to diversify off a platform is when it's working best for you."

### Pitfalls to Avoid
- Entering too late
- Over-investing in single platform
- Not building moat during opening
- Ignoring maturation signals

## Framework 5: Data Network Effects

**Source**: Casey Winters - Lenny's Podcast
**Key Insight**: Usage data can improve the product, creating a compounding advantage.

### What Are Data Network Effects?
Product improves as you get more data from users:
- Better recommendations
- Smarter defaults
- Improved algorithms
- Personalization

### Types of Data Advantages

**1. Personalization (Individual)**
- Your history improves your experience
- Example: Netflix recommendations

**2. Collective Intelligence (Aggregate)**
- All users' data improves everyone's experience
- Example: Waze traffic data

**3. Training Data (ML)**
- Data trains models that improve product
- Example: GPT trained on text

### Building Data Network Effects

**Step 1: Identify Data That Would Improve Product**
What data, if you had it, would make the product better?

**Step 2: Design Collection**
How can you collect this through product usage?

**Step 3: Build Feedback Loop**
Data → Improvement → More Usage → More Data

**Step 4: Make Improvement Visible**
Users should notice the product getting better

### Assessment Questions
- Does more usage generate valuable data?
- Does that data improve the product?
- Can competitors replicate this data?
- How long to accumulate meaningful advantage?

### Pitfalls to Avoid
- Assuming all data is valuable
- Not closing the loop (collecting but not using)
- Ignoring privacy concerns
- Overstating the moat (data often reproducible)

## Framework 6: PLG Fundamentals

**Source**: Elena Verna - Lenny's Podcast
**Key Insight**: Product-led growth uses the product itself as the primary driver of acquisition, conversion, and expansion.

### PLG Components

**Acquisition**: Users find and try product without sales
**Activation**: Users experience value quickly
**Monetization**: Users convert when ready
**Expansion**: Usage grows within accounts

### PLG vs. Sales-Led

| PLG | Sales-Led |
|-----|-----------|
| Self-serve trial | Demo required |
| Usage-based pricing | Contract negotiation |
| In-product conversion | Sales closes deal |
| User is buyer | Buyer ≠ user |

### PLG Metrics to Track
| Stage | Metrics |
|-------|---------|
| Acquisition | Sign-ups, visitor-to-signup |
| Activation | Time-to-value, activation rate |
| Monetization | Free-to-paid, trial conversion |
| Expansion | Net revenue retention, seat expansion |

### Common PLG Motions

**Freemium**: Free tier forever, pay for more
**Free Trial**: Full product, limited time
**Reverse Trial**: Start paid, downgrade if needed

### PLG + Sales Hybrid

Not either/or. Many successful companies layer sales on PLG:
1. PLG for self-serve segment
2. Sales for enterprise deals
3. Product-qualified leads (PQLs) route to sales

### Pitfalls to Avoid
- Forcing PLG where it doesn't fit
- No clear path to conversion
- Too much friction in trial
- Ignoring expansion revenue
