# Executive Communication Framework

## Metadata
- **Source**: Casey Winters - Lenny's Podcast
- **Domain**: Communication / Leadership
- **Type**: Framework SOP
- **Applicable To**: Product Managers, Product Leaders, Individual Contributors
- **Company Stage**: All stages (especially scaling companies)
- **Difficulty**: Intermediate

## Overview
Effective executive communication is about knowing where to start your story — not at chapter six (too deep), not at the beginning of time (too basic), but at the last point that would be obvious to your audience. The key insight: **executives communication is actually executives communication — you're talking to individual executives who each have different styles and concerns**.

## When to Use
- Product reviews with leadership
- Board presentations
- Cross-functional updates
- Escalating issues
- Seeking resources or decisions
- Sharing strategy or plans

## Prerequisites
- Understanding of each executive's style
- Knowledge of company strategy
- Clarity on what you're communicating
- Preparation time

## Core Concept: The Chapter Problem

### The Chapter Six Problem (Too Deep)
**What happens:**
- Start deep in the details
- Assume context everyone has
- Skip foundational elements
- Executive asks basic questions

**Example:**
> "So we're going to A/B test the checkout flow with these three variants..."
> Executive: "Wait, what's wrong with the checkout flow? Why are we working on this?"

### The Beginning of Time Problem (Too Basic)
**What happens:**
- Re-explain company strategy
- Describe who customers are
- Cover obvious context
- Run out of time for new information

**Example:**
> "So Eventbrite is a platform for event creators. Our customers create events and sell tickets. The event industry is worth..."
> Executive: "I know all this. What are you trying to tell me?"

### The Goldilocks Zone
**What to do:**
- Find the last point that would be completely obvious
- Start from there
- Build to the new information
- Earn the right to tell later chapters

## Procedure

### Step 1: Know Your Audience
Understand each executive's style and concerns.

**For each executive, map:**
| Executive | Primary Concern | Communication Style | Common Questions |
|-----------|-----------------|---------------------|------------------|
| CEO | Strategy, customer | Big picture, vision | Why does this matter? |
| CFO | Unit economics, ROI | Numbers, efficiency | What's the cost? Return? |
| CTO | Technical feasibility | Depth, tradeoffs | How will we build this? |
| CPO | User experience, strategy | Context, rationale | How does this fit? |

**Questions to ask:**
- What does this person care most about?
- What questions do they typically ask?
- What communication style do they prefer?
- What context do they already have?

### Step 2: Identify the Starting Point
Find where to begin your story.

**The test:**
> "What is the last point in my story that would be completely obvious to this audience?"

Start immediately after that point.

**Example mapping:**
| If audience knows... | Start with... |
|---------------------|---------------|
| Company strategy | How your work connects to strategy |
| The problem | Your hypothesis/approach |
| Your approach | Results so far |
| Results | Decision needed |

### Step 3: Structure Your Narrative
Build the story chapter by chapter.

**Chapter structure:**
1. **Connection to strategy**: What part of company strategy is this?
2. **Problem/opportunity**: What are we trying to solve/capture?
3. **Hypothesis/approach**: What are we doing and why?
4. **Progress/learnings**: What have we learned?
5. **Ask/decision**: What do you need from this audience?

**Adjust starting chapter based on audience knowledge:**
- Executive who assigned the project: Maybe start at chapter 3 or 4
- Executive new to this area: Start at chapter 1 or 2
- Quick status update: Maybe just chapter 4 and 5

### Step 4: Anticipate Questions
Prepare for what each executive will ask.

**Pre-meeting preparation:**
- List likely questions from each attendee
- Prepare answers (with supporting data)
- Identify questions you can't answer (and acknowledge)

**Common question patterns:**
| Executive Type | Likely Questions |
|----------------|------------------|
| Analytical | What does the data show? What's the sample size? |
| Strategic | How does this connect to our goals? |
| Operational | What's the timeline? Dependencies? |
| Financial | What's the cost? What's the ROI? |
| Customer-focused | How do customers feel about this? |

**Role-play the meeting:**
- Have someone play each executive
- Practice answering their likely questions
- Adjust your narrative based on gaps

### Step 5: De-Risk the Meeting
Avoid the big reveal.

**The mistake:**
- Saving everything for the big meeting
- Hoping for a dramatic "aha" moment
- High-stakes success or fail

**The better approach:**
- Have pre-meetings with key stakeholders
- Surface major concerns beforehand
- Build buy-in before the meeting
- Use the meeting to confirm, not convince

**Pre-meeting checklist:**
- [ ] Shared draft with key stakeholders
- [ ] Addressed major concerns
- [ ] Know where agreement exists
- [ ] Know where disagreement exists
- [ ] No surprises in the meeting

### Step 6: Communicate Trade-offs Explicitly
Don't hide the hard choices.

**The problem:**
- Leaders try to handle issues themselves
- Don't escalate or share constraints
- Executives don't have context to evaluate fairly

**The solution:**
- Surface constraints and trade-offs
- Explain decisions you've made
- Share what you gave up and why
- Ask for help changing circumstances if needed

**Trade-off communication template:**
> "We had to choose between X and Y. We chose X because [reason]. The trade-off is [what we gave up]. If we could change [circumstance], we could have both."

### Step 7: Match Communication to Level
Different audiences need different depth.

**Executive team:**
- Strategy connection
- Key decisions
- High-level metrics
- Trade-offs and risks

**Direct manager:**
- Progress and blockers
- Detailed metrics
- Specific asks
- Full context

**Cross-functional partners:**
- What they need to know
- How it affects their work
- What you need from them
- Timeline and dependencies

**Your team:**
- Context and why
- Detailed plans
- Their specific role
- How success is measured

## Expected Outcomes
- More productive executive meetings
- Faster decision-making
- Better resource allocation
- Clearer alignment
- Improved reputation and trust

## Common Pitfalls

### Under-communicating upward
- Assuming executives know what's happening
- Not sharing constraints or trade-offs
- Then complaining executives are "out of touch"
- They can't help if they don't know

### Speaking different languages
- Executive questions feel like a foreign language
- You're in the weeds, they're at 30,000 feet
- Bridge the gap with context

### Not preparing for the specific audience
- Same presentation for every executive
- Ignoring their individual concerns
- Treating it as one audience
- Customize for who's in the room

### Saving everything for the big meeting
- High stakes, high risk
- No opportunity to course-correct
- Pre-meetings de-risk the outcome

### Starting at chapter six
- Assuming shared context
- Skipping foundational elements
- Executive spends meeting catching up
- Start where they can follow

## AI Integration Notes

### Context signals that should trigger this SOP:
- Preparing for executive presentation
- "How do I communicate this to leadership?"
- Post-meeting that went poorly
- Stakeholder alignment challenges

### How to apply:
- Help identify starting point
- Map executive concerns
- Structure the narrative
- Anticipate questions

### Key insight:
Executive communication is about starting in the right place — not too deep (chapter six), not too basic (beginning of time), but at the last point that would be obvious to your specific audience.
