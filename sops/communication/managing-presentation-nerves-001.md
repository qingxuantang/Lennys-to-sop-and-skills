- **Difficulty**: Beginner to Intermediate

## Overview
A collection of evidence-based techniques for managing presentation anxiety and stage fright, drawn from Nancy Duarte's experience coaching presenters and her own practices. Recognizes that nerves often indicate deep, thoughtful content worth sharing, and provides practical methods to channel anxiety into effective delivery.

## When to Use
- Before any presentation where you feel nervous
- When preparing for high-stakes talks (keynotes, board presentations, major pitches)
- When famous or important people will be in your audience
- Before internal presentations where you feel extra pressure
- When you notice physical symptoms of anxiety (racing heart, shallow breathing, sweating)
- During the moments immediately before going on stage

## Prerequisites
- Acceptance that some nervousness is normal and even beneficial
- Willingness to experiment with different techniques
- Time to practice pre-talk rituals
- Self-awareness about your energy level and needs

## Procedure

### Step 1: Reframe Your Nervousness as a Positive Signal
Change your mental model about what nerves mean.

**The reality**:
- People who are thoughtful and contemplative about speaking often have better content
- Nervous presenters tend to be deeper thinkers who really consider their message
- Your nervousness shows you care about delivering value
- It's a sign you're taking the audience seriously

**What Nancy says**: "Anyone who tells me 'I am a nervous presenter,' I'm like, you probably have gorgeous content in your heart that the world needs to hear, because usually they are really deep and thoughtful."

**Contrast with overconfidence**:
- "I got this, I'll just wing it" often leads to shallow content
- People who never get nervous may not be thinking deeply enough
- Preparation and thoughtfulness naturally create some anxiety

**Mental shift**: "My nerves mean I have something valuable to share" vs. "My nerves mean I'm not good at this"

### Step 2: Understand the Fight-or-Flight Response
Recognize what's happening in your body and why.

**The physiology**:
- Your body perceives the stage as a threat (like being attacked by an animal)
- Fight-or-flight response kicks in
- Adrenaline, cortisol, increased heart rate, rapid breathing
- This is automatic, not a sign of weakness

**The key insight**: Your body can't tell the difference between:
- Being attacked by a predator
- Standing in front of an audience

**What this means**:
- You're not broken; your survival system is working
- The response is chemical and automatic
- You can work with it, not against it
- Physical interventions can help reset the chemistry

### Step 3: Choose Your Pre-Talk Energy Strategy
Identify whether you need to calm down or pump up (most people need one or the other).

#### Strategy A: Calming Down (For High-Energy People)
If you tend toward over-the-top energy or anxiety:

**Nancy's approach** (she uses this one):
- Find the darkest, quietest corner backstage
- Avoid the green room and social chatter
- Sit calmly and focus on breathing
- Stay focused on content, not socializing
- "I have to calm myself down because I already have over-the-top energy"

**Breathing technique**:
1. Take a deep, deep breath
2. While lungs are still full, take another gulp of air
3. Hold briefly
4. Let it out very slowly and controlled
5. Repeat 3-5 times

**What to avoid**:
- Don't jump around or do high-energy movements
- Don't consume caffeine close to talk time
- Don't engage in stimulating conversations
- Don't try techniques meant for low-energy people

**Nancy's cautionary tale**: "I tried stretching and jumping with arms up before a talk at a medical company. They called my assistant afterward worried I needed a doctor because I could never control my breathing. I pumped myself up when I needed to calm down."

#### Strategy B: Pumping Up (For Low-Energy People)
If you tend toward low energy or need activation:

**Alternative approach**:
- Play heavy metal music
- Do physical movements (jumping, stretching)
- Get the body activated and blood flowing
- Move around the convention center
- Build energetic momentum

**Nancy's friend's approach**: "Play heavy metal music and skip around the entire convention center to get all fired up"

**When this works**:
- If you're naturally low-energy or calm
- If you tend to be too mellow or flat
- If you need physical activation to perform
- If quiet makes you more anxious

### Step 4: Use Chemical Reset Techniques
Intentionally shift your body chemistry before going on stage.

#### Technique A: Laughter Reset
Most reliable for shifting from nervous to confident.

**How Nancy does it**:
- Keeps a playlist of funny videos/content
- Never watches them except right before talks
- Maintains freshness so they still make her laugh
- Watches one funny thing immediately before going on

**Why it works**:
- Laughter chemically shifts your entire body
- Moves you from cortisol (stress) to endorphins (happiness)
- Creates positive emotional state
- Breaks the anxiety cycle

**Nancy's example**: "Low-watched video of a guy with tin cans wrapped around his waist playing them. My husband mimics it around the house. It transports me home and makes me laugh. I can probably sing the beat."

**How to build your playlist**:
- Collect funny videos/TikToks/clips that genuinely make you laugh
- Tag them but don't rewatch
- Keep them fresh for pre-talk use
- Choose things that work reliably for you
- Can include things that remind you of loved ones

#### Technique B: Environmental Familiarization
Reduce fear of the unknown by making the space familiar.

**Process**:
1. Before your talk, sit in the audience seating
2. Look at the stage from audience perspective
3. Picture yourself standing there
4. Imagine a friendly, smiling face in the seats
5. When you present, remember that friendly face you visualized

**Why it works**:
- Demystifies the scary stage
- Creates a mental anchor of safety
- Gives you a "friendly face" to look for
- Reduces fear of unknown environment

**Nancy's insight**: "Picture yourself as that friendly face, the one that's happy to see you, delighted that you're speaking. Remember that face when you're standing up there."

### Step 5: Change Your Visual Model of the Audience
Replace scary mental images with supportive ones.

**The problem**: Your brain creates threatening images:
- Scowling faces
- People judging you
- Doubtful expressions
- Critical thoughts

**The reality**: These images are only in your head:
- Most audience members want you to succeed
- They're hoping to learn something valuable
- They're not thinking about you as much as you think
- Friendly faces exist in every audience

**The practice**:
- Before going on stage, visualize friendly, encouraging faces
- Remember times people were genuinely happy to hear you speak
- Picture the audience as allies, not enemies
- Recall that they chose to be there (in most cases)

**Nancy's note**: "You have to change your visual model that people's faces will be scowling, judging, doubting. All those things are only in your head."

### Step 6: Focus on Your Content, Not Yourself
Shift attention from self-consciousness to service.

**The shift**:
- From: "What will they think of me?"
- To: "How can I help them?"

**Practical actions**:
- Review your key points one more time
- Remind yourself why this message matters
- Think about the person who needs to hear this most
- Focus on the value you're delivering
- Remember: audience is the hero, you're the mentor

**Nancy's approach**: "I have to be focused on my content. I don't like to hear gibber jabber. I find the dark corner and calmly sit and just breathe, focused on content."

### Step 7: Develop Your Personal Pre-Talk Ritual
Create a consistent routine that signals your brain "it's time to perform."

**Components to consider**:
- Timing (how long before talk do you start?)
- Location (where will you be?)
- Social (alone or with specific people?)
- Physical (breathing, movement, stillness?)
- Mental (visualization, content review, meditation?)
- Sensory (music, videos, silence?)

**Nancy's ritual**:
1. Find darkest, quietest corner backstage
2. Avoid green room and social interaction
3. Sit calmly
4. Deep breathing technique (described above)
5. Stay focused on content
6. Watch one funny video to shift chemistry
7. Walk on stage

**Key principle**: Experiment to find what works for YOUR energy and personality
- What works for others may not work for you
- High-energy people need different approaches than low-energy
- Consistency helps (same ritual = reliable results)

### Step 8: Handle Specific High-Pressure Scenarios

#### When Famous People Are in Audience
- Use the laughter reset technique immediately before
- Remind yourself they're human too
- Focus on your message, not their status
- Remember: they chose to attend because they're interested

#### When Presenting to Your Own Team
- Recognize this is often harder than external talks
- They're more skeptical (you might change their priorities)
- Do extra empathy research beforehand
- Acknowledge their concerns directly
- Remember: they respect your expertise

#### When You're Under-Prepared
- Focus on your three main points
- Be honest about constraints if appropriate
- Rely on your expertise and authenticity
- Remember: audience doesn't know what you planned to say

## Expected Outcomes
- Reduced physical symptoms of anxiety
- Ability to channel nervous energy into presence
- More consistent performance across presentations
- Faster recovery from pre-talk jitters
- Increased confidence over time
- Better delivery despite initial nervousness
- Audience doesn't notice your internal anxiety

## Common Pitfalls
- **Using wrong technique for your energy type**: Pumping up when you need to calm down (or vice versa) - Nancy's medical company story
- **Avoiding the nervousness**: Trying to eliminate it completely rather than working with it
- **Caffeine too close to talk time**: Amplifies jittery feelings for many people
- **No consistent ritual**: Random approaches don't train your brain
- **Comparing yourself to others**: What works for someone else may not work for you
- **Staying in green room**: Social energy can be draining or distracting
- **Not practicing the ritual**: Trying it for first time on presentation day
- **Focusing on perfection**: One um or pacing too much doesn't ruin the talk
- **Forgetting to breathe**: Holding breath amplifies anxiety
- **Ignoring your body's signals**: Not recognizing whether you're over- or under-energized

## Real-World Examples

### Example 1: Nancy's Chemical Reset Success
**Situation**: Nervous before talks, especially with famous people in audience
**Technique**: Playlist of funny videos she hasn't watched, watches one right before stage
**Result**: "Chemically shifts my whole body from nervous to laughter"

### Example 2: Nancy's Failed Pump-Up Attempt
**Situation**: Presenting at major medical company
**Mistake**: Tried stretching and jumping (pump-up technique) when she needed to calm down
**Result**: Couldn't control breathing during talk; company called afterward worried she needed a doctor
**Learning**: Know your energy type and stick with what works for you

### Example 3: Friend's Heavy Metal Approach
**Situation**: Presenter needed activation before talks
**Technique**: Headbanging to heavy metal, skipping around convention center
**Result**: Perfect energy level for their presentation style
**Key**: Opposite of Nancy's approach - same goal, different path

### Example 4: Presenting to Duarte Team (Nancy)
**Situation**: "Presenting in front of presentation experts"
**Challenge**: Team notices every flaw - one imperfect slide, saying "um," pacing too much
**Reality**: "I get really nervous... You lose a third of your team each time. They're such experts. It's hard."
**Approach**: Extra preparation, deeper content focus, acceptance of imperfection

## AI Integration Notes

### Context Signals That Trigger This SOP
- User mentions feeling nervous about upcoming presentation
- User asks about stage fright or presentation anxiety
- User describes physical symptoms (racing heart, sweating, etc.)
- User mentions high-stakes talk coming up
- User expresses self-doubt about presenting ability
- User mentions important/famous people in audience
- User is presenting to internal team and feeling pressure

### How to Adapt for Different Situations
- **For first-time presenters**: Start with calming techniques (breathing, familiar environment)
- **For experienced presenters with specific fears**: Focus on chemical reset and visualization
- **For high-energy personalities**: Emphasize calming down strategies
- **For low-energy personalities**: Suggest activation techniques
- **For remote presentations**: Adapt rituals for home environment (still works!)
- **For impromptu talks**: Use quick breathing technique and content focus
- **For multiple presentations in one day**: Shorter rituals between talks

### Limitations and Edge Cases
- Severe anxiety may require professional support beyond these techniques
- Medical conditions affecting breathing or heart rate need doctor consultation
- Cultural contexts where showing nervousness has different implications
- Virtual presentations have different dynamics (can't visit the "stage")
- Some venues don't allow private space for pre-talk rituals
- Medication or substances may interact with anxiety management
- Performance anxiety tied to trauma may need therapeutic intervention
- Not all nervousness is bad - some level enhances performance
- Techniques take practice - won't work perfectly the first time
