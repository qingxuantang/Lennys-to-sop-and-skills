## Overview
Complex product concepts are hard to align teams around when described abstractly. Metaphors and "emulators" — real products that embody your intended experience — create shared understanding quickly. The key insight: **when you can say "we want to feel like WhatsApp for X," you've created a powerful alignment shortcut that conveys product philosophy, not just features**.

## When to Use
- Defining new product direction
- Aligning team on product feel/philosophy
- Communicating vision across functions
- Onboarding new team members
- Resolving debates about product approach

## Prerequisites
- Understanding of your product's core essence
- Knowledge of products that embody similar qualities
- Ability to articulate what you're NOT trying to be
- Team open to metaphorical thinking

## Core Concept: Emulators and Metaphors

### What is an Emulator?
A reference product that embodies the experience you're trying to create.

**Purpose:**
- Creates shared vocabulary
- Conveys philosophy, not just features
- Provides concrete reference point
- Enables fast decision-making

**Example (WhatsApp):**
> "WhatsApp wants to feel like face-to-face communication. When you're in a conversation with someone in person, you're not thinking about the medium — you're just talking. That's what we want messaging to feel like."

**What this enables:**
- "Would face-to-face communication have read receipts?" (Yes — you can see them listening)
- "Would face-to-face communication have typing indicators?" (Yes — you see them thinking)
- "Would face-to-face communication have message scheduling?" (No — that's not how presence works)

### Emulator vs. Feature List

| Feature List | Emulator |
|--------------|----------|
| "Fast, simple, reliable messaging" | "Feel like face-to-face conversation" |
| "User-friendly interface" | "Feel like talking to a friend, not using software" |
| "Collaborative editing" | "Feel like everyone in the same room with a whiteboard" |
| "Personalized recommendations" | "Feel like a really knowledgeable friend suggesting things" |

**Why emulators work better:**
- Convey the "why" behind features
- Create framework for new decisions
- Easier to remember and reference
- More emotionally resonant

### Types of Metaphors

**Product emulators:**
- "We want to be the Stripe of X" (developer-friendly, just works)
- "We want to be the Apple of X" (beautiful, premium, integrated)
- "We want to be the Amazon of X" (selection, convenience, reliable)

**Experience emulators:**
- "Feel like talking to a friend"
- "Feel like browsing a bookstore"
- "Feel like having a personal assistant"

**Anti-emulators:**
- "We don't want to be the [product]"
- Defines what you're explicitly avoiding
- Often as powerful as positive emulators

## Procedure

### Step 1: Identify Core Experience
Define the essential feeling you want to create.

**Questions to ask:**
- What should using this product feel like?
- What emotion should users have?
- What would users compare this to in the real world?
- What makes this different from alternatives?

**Exercise:**
Complete the sentence: "Using our product should feel like _____"
- Not: "Using our product has features X, Y, Z"
- Yes: "Using our product feels like having a expert guide you"

### Step 2: Find Your Emulator
Identify a product or experience that embodies your target.

**Emulator selection criteria:**
| Criterion | Question |
|-----------|----------|
| Recognition | Will the team know this reference? |
| Relevance | Does it capture your core feeling? |
| Clarity | Does it give clear decision guidance? |
| Inspiration | Does it set a high bar? |

**Finding emulators:**
- Look outside your industry for analogies
- Consider real-world (non-digital) experiences
- Ask "what product do I admire for quality X?"
- Consider the user's other experiences

### Step 3: Define Emulator in Detail
Articulate specifically what the emulator means for you.

**Definition template:**
> "We want to be like [emulator] because [specific quality]. This means we [do X] and [don't do Y]. You can see this in how [emulator] handles [specific example]."

**Example:**
> "We want to feel like Notion for [domain]. Notion feels like a flexible workspace that adapts to you, rather than forcing you into rigid templates. This means we prioritize customization over optimization, and we don't lock users into predefined workflows. You can see this in how Notion lets you structure pages however you want."

### Step 4: Create Anti-Emulators
Define what you explicitly don't want to be.

**Anti-emulator template:**
> "We don't want to be [anti-emulator] because [specific quality to avoid]. This means we avoid [behavior]. You can see how [anti-emulator] does this wrong when [example]."

**Example:**
> "We don't want to be like enterprise software that requires training to use. This means we avoid complex configuration and nested menus. You can see this in how [competitor] requires a 2-week implementation."

### Step 5: Socialize and Use
Make the emulator part of team vocabulary.

**Socialization:**
- Include in product principles documentation
- Reference in roadmap discussions
- Use in design reviews
- Cite when making trade-off decisions
- Onboard new team members with it

**Usage patterns:**
- "Does this feel like [emulator]?"
- "What would [emulator] do here?"
- "This is getting dangerously close to [anti-emulator]"
- "That's not [emulator] — that's [something else]"

### Step 6: Evolve the Emulator
Update as product and market evolve.

**When to update:**
- Emulator becomes dated/irrelevant
- Your product has evolved beyond it
- Team understanding has deepened
- Better emulator becomes available

**Evolution approach:**
- Document the evolution
- Explain why emulator is changing
- Maintain continuity where possible
- Don't change too frequently

## Application Examples

### Example 1: Developer Tools
**Emulator:** "Feel like using a power tool that experts love"
- What it means: Powerful, efficient, learnable depth
- Design decisions: Keyboard shortcuts, advanced features accessible but not required
- Anti-emulator: "Don't feel like enterprise software with training requirements"

### Example 2: Consumer App
**Emulator:** "Feel like texting a friend"
- What it means: Casual, fast, personal
- Design decisions: Informal tone, quick interactions, no ceremony
- Anti-emulator: "Don't feel like filling out a form"

### Example 3: B2B SaaS
**Emulator:** "Feel like Stripe — it just works"
- What it means: Minimal setup, smart defaults, reliability
- Design decisions: Self-serve, great documentation, progressive disclosure
- Anti-emulator: "Don't feel like you need a consultant to get started"

## Expected Outcomes
- Faster team alignment
- More coherent product decisions
- Clearer product philosophy
- Better cross-functional communication
- Easier onboarding

## Common Pitfalls

### Copying features, not philosophy
- "Slack has channels, so should we"
- Missing the underlying principle
- Cargo-culting surface features
- Emulator is about philosophy, not features

### Using unknown emulators
- Team doesn't know the reference
- No shared understanding created
- Reference falls flat
- Choose widely-known emulators

### Too many emulators
- "We're Stripe meets Notion meets TikTok"
- Conflicting philosophies
- No clear direction
- One primary emulator is best

### Static emulator
- Product evolved, emulator didn't
- Reference no longer accurate
- Team confused by mismatch
- Update emulator as you evolve

### Emulator worship
- Copying everything, not adapting
- Not questioning if it applies
- Losing your own identity
- Emulator is guide, not gospel

## AI Integration Notes

### Context signals that should trigger this SOP:
- "How do I explain our product vision?"
- "Team isn't aligned on direction"
- "What kind of product are we building?"
- Product philosophy discussions

### How to apply:
- Help identify core experience target
- Suggest potential emulator products
- Define what emulator means specifically
- Create anti-emulators for clarity

### Key insight:
The power of an emulator is that it conveys philosophy and feeling, not just features. "Feel like face-to-face conversation" tells you more about what to build than any feature list could. When the team can reference a shared emulator, decisions get faster and more coherent.
