# Presentation Structure: What Is, What Could Be Framework

## Metadata
- **Source**: Nancy Duarte - Lenny's Podcast
- **Domain**: Communication/Presentation Design
- **Type**: Framework
- **Applicable To**: Product Managers, Founders, Executives, Presenters at all levels
- **Difficulty**: Beginner to Intermediate

## Overview
A story-based presentation structure that creates longing and drives action by contrasting current reality ("what is") with an improved future state ("what could be"), ending with a vision of the new reality achieved ("new bliss"). This framework applies to everything from major keynotes to small meeting presentations and even everyday influence conversations.

## When to Use
- When you need to persuade an audience to adopt a new idea or change behavior
- When presenting a product vision, company strategy, or transformation initiative
- During sales conversations or fundraising pitches
- In team meetings when proposing a new approach or process
- When trying to influence someone to take action (even casual conversations)
- Any time you need to create desire for a future state

## Prerequisites
- Clear understanding of your audience's current situation (empathy)
- A defined vision of the improved future state
- Specific actions you want the audience to take
- Understanding of what makes the change worthwhile

## Procedure

### Step 1: Establish "What Is" (Current Reality)
Set up the presentation by stating the current situation clearly and honestly.
- Begin with the status quo or current problem state
- Use concrete details and specific examples
- For longer presentations, provide substantial context
- For brief interactions, a quick setup is sufficient
- Ensure the audience recognizes and relates to this reality

**Example (Short)**: "Right now, our onboarding takes 5 steps and users drop off at 40%"
**Example (Long)**: "Currently, when a new user signs up, they face a complex 5-step process that requires creating an account, verifying email, completing a profile, connecting integrations, and setting preferences. Our data shows 40% abandon before completion, and those who finish report confusion about what to do next."

### Step 2: Contrast with "What Could Be" (Future State)
Immediately after stating "what is," present the improved alternative.
- Paint a picture of the improved future state
- Make the contrast stark and clear
- Use vivid, concrete language to help them see it
- Show how the solution addresses the current problem
- Create emotional resonance with the improvement

**Example**: "Imagine if we simplified to one-click signup with Google, and users could start using the product immediately, with a 5-minute interactive tutorial. Early tests show 85% completion rates."

### Step 3: Build the Rhythm - Alternate Between What Is and What Could Be
Create a pulsing cadence by moving back and forth between current state and future state.
- Move from "what could be" back down to another "what is"
- Then rise again to another "what could be"
- Repeat this pattern: what is → what could be → what is → what could be
- Each cycle builds increasing longing for the future state
- The rise and fall creates tension and release (key to story engagement)

**Pattern Example**:
- What is: "Our current checkout has 7 fields to complete"
- What could be: "We could reduce to 3 fields using smart defaults"
- What is: "Right now, mobile users have to pinch and zoom to fill forms"
- What could be: "The new design auto-sizes for mobile with large touch targets"

### Step 4: End with "New Bliss" (Future State Achieved)
Conclude by painting a complete picture of the world with your idea fully adopted.
- Describe the end state where the change has been implemented
- Make it vivid and aspirational
- Connect to larger outcomes (increased human flourishing, team success, customer delight)
- Create a vision worth working toward
- This becomes the horizontal line at the top - the new reality

**Example**: "Six months from now, new users will tell their friends how easy it was to get started. Our support tickets will drop by 60%. And our team can focus on building features instead of troubleshooting onboarding issues. That's the world we're building toward."

### Step 5: Adapt Length and Depth to Context
Scale the framework based on your situation.
- **Major presentation/keynote**: Full development with multiple cycles, strong visuals, rehearsed delivery
- **Team meeting**: 3-5 minute version with 2-3 contrast cycles
- **One-on-one conversation**: Quick what is → what could be → new bliss (under 2 minutes)
- **Written communication**: Use the structure in emails or memos
- **Casual influence**: Even asking your spouse to do chores can use this pattern

## Visual Representation
Picture this as a graph over time:
- Bottom line = "What Is" (current reality)
- Top area = "What Could Be" (future state)
- The presentation moves up and down between these two lines
- Each rise creates longing, each return to reality creates tension
- Final line at top = "New Bliss" (achieved future state)

Like "pumpkin teeth" or a zigzag pattern that moves forward in time.

## Expected Outcomes
- Audience understands the gap between current and future state
- Creates emotional longing for the improved future
- Builds motivation to take the requested action
- Memorable structure that audiences retain
- Higher likelihood of idea adoption and behavior change

## Common Pitfalls
- **Only describing the future state**: Without contrast to current reality, there's no tension or longing. Always establish "what is" first.
- **Too much "what is" without hope**: If you only talk about problems, people get depressed. Balance with frequent visits to "what could be."
- **Vague future states**: "Things will be better" doesn't work. Be specific and concrete about the improvement.
- **Forgetting the new bliss**: Don't just alternate forever. End with a clear, aspirational vision of success.
- **Applying same depth everywhere**: A board presentation needs full development; a hallway conversation needs the quick version.
- **Thinking it only works for big talks**: This framework works in any moment of influence, from stages to dinner tables.

## Real-World Examples

### Example 1: Steve Jobs iPhone Launch
- What is: Current state of mobile phones and their limitations
- What could be: Revolutionary new interface and capabilities
- What is: How frustrating current smartphones are (Blackberry comparison)
- What could be: The iPhone's superior approach
- New bliss: A world where everyone has this powerful computer in their pocket

### Example 2: Dr. Martin Luther King Jr. "I Have a Dream"
- What is: Current state of inequality and injustice
- What could be: Vision of equality and justice
- Repeated pattern building to the dream
- New bliss: The fully realized dream of equality

### Example 3: Al Gore "An Inconvenient Truth"
- What is: Current environmental data and trends
- What could be: What happens if we act vs. don't act
- Pattern of problem → solution throughout
- New bliss: A sustainable future for our children

### Example 4: Getting Your Spouse to Help (Nancy's Personal Example)
- What is: "Tomorrow I have back-to-back meetings, including Lenny's Podcast right when the dog gets whiny. Next week is packed too, and when I'm stressed I'm hard to deal with..."
- What could be: "The doggy daycare - she loved it last time, was spooning with another dog..."
- New bliss: "You taking her means I can focus on the podcast, be present for work, and be pleasant at the end of the day."

## AI Integration Notes

### Context Signals That Trigger This SOP
- User is preparing a presentation or pitch
- User needs to persuade or influence someone
- User is working on change management communication
- User mentions needing to get buy-in for an idea
- User is struggling to make their argument compelling

### How to Adapt for Different Situations
- **For technical audiences**: Keep "what is" data-rich and specific; "what could be" should show measurable improvements
- **For executive audiences**: Start with conclusion (new bliss) then unpack the journey
- **For creative teams**: Use more vivid, emotional language in both states
- **For sales contexts**: "What is" = customer's current pain; "what could be" = life with your solution
- **For internal teams**: "What is" needs empathy and detail; they need to see you understand their current challenges

### Limitations and Edge Cases
- Doesn't work well for pure information transfer (use different structure)
- Less effective when audience is already fully convinced (no need for persuasion)
- May seem manipulative if the "what could be" is unrealistic or dishonest
- Requires genuine empathy for current state - can't fake understanding
- Some cultures prefer different narrative structures (research cultural context)
- Very analytical audiences may want data/proof before accepting "what could be" claims
