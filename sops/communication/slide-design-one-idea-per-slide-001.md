- **Type**: Framework + Process
- **Applicable To**: Anyone creating presentation slides, Product Managers, Designers, Executives
- **Difficulty**: Beginner to Intermediate

## Overview
A core principle for effective slide design: each slide should make exactly one point in support of your presentation's big idea. This approach improves comprehension, retention, and impact by respecting the cognitive limits of your audience. Includes guidance on adapting this principle across different presentation contexts from cinematic keynotes to dense slide docs.

## When to Use
- When creating any presentation with slides
- When reviewing and editing existing presentations
- When audience feedback suggests confusion or information overload
- When preparing slides for different contexts (stage vs. meeting vs. circulated document)
- When designing templates or slide standards for your organization

## Prerequisites
- Clear "big idea" for your overall presentation (know your main point)
- Understanding of your audience journey (where you're moving them from/to)
- Awareness of your presentation context (stage, meeting, or slide doc)

## Procedure

### Step 1: Define Your Presentation's One Big Idea
Before creating any slides, crystallize your overarching message.

**The Big Idea framework**:
- **Point of view**: What is your specific perspective or recommendation?
- **Stakes**: What happens if they do or don't adopt it?
- **Audience journey**: Where are you moving them from → to?

**Questions to answer**:
- If the audience remembers only one thing, what should it be?
- What decision or action am I driving toward?
- What's fundamentally at stake?

**Example Big Ideas**:
- "We must shift to mobile-first or lose millennial users" (stakes clear)
- "This new onboarding flow will increase activation 40%" (point of view + impact)
- "Investing in design systems now saves 1000 engineering hours next year" (value prop)

**Key principle**: Every single slide must support this big idea. If it doesn't, delete it.

### Step 2: Identify the One Point for Each Slide
For every slide you create, define its singular purpose.

**The test**: Can you state in one sentence what this slide is trying to communicate?

**Good single-point slides**:
- "User retention increased 25% after the change"
- "Our three main competitors are vulnerable on mobile"
- "The new architecture reduces latency by 50%"
- "Here's what success looks like"

**Bad multi-point slides** (avoid these):
- Trying to show retention AND acquisition AND revenue on one slide
- Mixing problem description with solution details
- Combining multiple products/features without clear relationship
- Cramming entire project status into one table

**Nancy's rule**: "Each slide should make one point. People can't process too many things at one time."

### Step 3: Choose the Right Slide Type for Your Point
Match your slide format to the type of information you're conveying.

#### Slide Types and When to Use

**Conceptual/Big Picture**:
- **Format**: Single powerful image, minimal or no text
- **When**: Opening, transitions, emotional moments
- **Example**: Full-bleed photo that captures the essence of your message

**Data/Evidence**:
- **Format**: Chart, graph, or dramatic number
- **When**: Supporting claims with evidence
- **Example**: One big metric with trend line
- **Nancy's example**: The word "BIG" in magenta pink filling entire screen

**Process/Flow**:
- **Format**: Diagram showing relationships or sequence
- **When**: Explaining how something works
- **Example**: Architecture diagram, user flow, timeline

**Comparison**:
- **Format**: Side-by-side or before/after
- **When**: Showing contrast or options
- **Example**: Current state vs. future state

**Action/Recommendation**:
- **Format**: Clear headline with supporting bullets (3-5 max)
- **When**: Stating what to do next
- **Example**: "Three steps to implement..."

**Dense Information** (only for specific contexts):
- **Format**: Table, detailed diagram, or text-heavy slide
- **When**: Internal meetings with peers, slide docs, technical reviews
- **Example**: Project status table everyone on team uses regularly

### Step 4: Adapt Density Based on Context
Recognize that different presentation contexts require different approaches.

#### Context A: Keynote/Stage Presentation
**Audience**: Large, passive viewing
**Goal**: Inspire, persuade, create memorable experience

**Slide approach**:
- Highly cinematic visuals
- Minimal text (often just images)
- One clear visual concept per slide
- Lots of slides moving quickly
- Production quality matters

**Example**: TED Talk, product launch, conference keynote

#### Context B: Meeting Presentation
**Audience**: Small group, active discussion
**Goal**: Align on decisions, share updates, collaborate

**Slide approach**:
- Clear headlines with key points
- Moderate density (more than stage, less than doc)
- Diagrams team can discuss together
- Tables/frameworks team regularly uses
- Room for annotation and discussion

**What Nancy says**: "If you're in a room with your peers and everyone has their own shorthand and way of working, put that common slide up there. Everyone's used to using it, so there's no harm in using a commonly known framework or slide or table."

#### Context C: Slide Doc (Circulated Document)
**Audience**: Individual readers, no presenter
**Goal**: Comprehensive information transfer, reference document

**Slide approach**:
- Full sentences and paragraphs
- Denser information (can include more per slide)
- Stronger pictures alongside text
- Extensive appendix (can be 100 pages)
- Front section might be only 5 summary slides

**Nancy's principle**: "We contend that if you add words and pictures, the six-page memo is better. How do you send a memo around without the help of a presenter?"

**Example**: Amazon's 6-page memo concept, but with visuals

### Step 5: Apply the Repository Warning
Avoid the temptation of copying old slides without thought.

**The common mistake**:
- Presenter goes to data repository
- Finds old presentations on similar topics
- Copies slides without adapting to current audience
- Assembles frankendeck of reused content

**Why this fails**:
- Old slides were designed for different audience
- Context has changed
- One-size-fits-all rarely works
- Misses the empathy requirement

**The better approach**:
- Repository can get you halfway there (starting point)
- But you must modify and map content to THIS audience
- Especially critical for high-stakes presentations
- Ask: "Does this slide serve my current big idea and audience?"

**Nancy's guidance**: "Most people go to some repository and dig through old crappy slides to assemble something super quickly. That's a cop-out. You should be modifying and mapping all content based on who you're talking to."

### Step 6: Design the Slide to Support the One Point

#### Visual Hierarchy
Make the most important element most prominent:
- Largest size
- Highest contrast
- Prime position (often upper left or center)
- Distinctive color

#### Text Guidelines
- **Headline**: The one point stated clearly
  - Some brands want key insight at top
  - Some want action to be taken
  - Some want dreamy future state
  - Consulting firms often put conclusion in lower right corner
- **Supporting text**: Minimal, just enough to clarify
- **Body text**: Very limited or none (save for slide docs)

**Nancy's note**: "It's kind of up to the brand and everyone believes it belongs somewhere else."

#### Image Selection
- Should directly relate to the point
- Creates emotional resonance or clarifies concept
- Not just decoration or generic stock photo
- Full-bleed images can be powerful

#### Data Visualization
- Highlight the key number or trend
- Annotate what audience should notice
- Remove extraneous data
- One chart per slide (don't combine multiple charts)

### Step 7: Edit Ruthlessly
Review and refine to ensure one point per slide.

**The editing process**:
1. Look at each slide in isolation
2. State out loud: "This slide's point is..."
3. If you can't state it in one sentence, split it
4. If the slide doesn't support the big idea, delete it
5. If two slides make the same point, merge or delete one

**Warning signs of multi-point slides**:
- You find yourself saying "and also..." when describing it
- Audience asks questions suggesting confusion
- The slide takes more than 30-60 seconds to explain
- Multiple competing visual elements
- Everything is the same size/prominence (no hierarchy)

**Nancy's test**: "Don't make a single slide unless it supports the one big idea of your whole talk."

## Expected Outcomes
- Faster audience comprehension
- Higher information retention
- Less confusion and fewer questions
- More impactful presentations
- Clearer communication of key points
- Easier for audience to follow your logic
- Better engagement (not overwhelmed)

## Common Pitfalls
- **Trying to save slides**: Cramming multiple points onto one slide to keep deck short (false economy)
- **Ignoring context**: Using same density for stage and meeting presentations
- **Unclear big idea**: Can't create focused slides if you don't know your main point
- **Repository reuse without adaptation**: Copy-paste from old decks without customization
- **No headline/point**: Slides with just data or image but no clear takeaway
- **Everything is important**: If you don't prioritize, nothing stands out
- **Audience mismatch**: High-density slides for general audience or vice versa
- **Inconsistent standards**: Some slides follow the rule, others don't (confusing experience)
- **Decoration over function**: Pretty slides that don't make clear points
- **Fear of many slides**: It's okay to have 100 slides if each is simple and clear

## Real-World Examples

### Example 1: Apple's "BIG" Slide (Nancy's Story)
**Context**: 1992 sales conference, era of text-heavy slides
**Challenge**: Sales leader wanted revolutionary slide
**Solution**: Single word "BIG" in hot pink on black background, filling entire screen
**Impact**: Production team gasped and squealed, became unforgettable moment, lit up audience faces
**Lesson**: One dramatic idea, executed boldly, is more powerful than dense information

### Example 2: Think Different Campaign Slides (Nancy's Story)
**Context**: Steve Jobs returning to Apple, Think Different campaign launch
**Problem**: Designers creating cluttered backgrounds with bevels and photo frames
**Solution**: Nancy found stock video of floating particulates (like Hitchcock posters), used with Apple logo
**Impact**: Revolutionary for the time, pushed medium forward, maintained brand elegance
**Lesson**: One visual concept (particulates + logo) supporting one campaign idea

### Example 3: Nancy's Internal Team Presentations
**Context**: Team of presentation experts evaluating her work
**Challenge**: "One slide that's flawed or I say um or I pace too much. You lose a third of your team."
**Approach**: Every slide must be defensible, each with clear single purpose
**Lesson**: Even experts struggle when each slide doesn't have clear purpose

### Example 4: Slide Doc vs. Presentation (Nancy's Distinction)
**Situation**: Need to circulate information without presenter
**Solution**: "Slide doc" - front 5 slides with key points, 100-page appendix with details
**Format**: Full sentences, stronger pictures, comprehensive information
**Lesson**: Different contexts need different approaches, but one-idea-per-slide still applies to the summary

## Contextual Variations

### For Technical Audiences
- Tables and diagrams can be denser
- Technical peers understand shorthand
- Common frameworks don't need explanation
- Still: one clear point per slide (even if slide is dense)

### For Executive Audiences
- Extremely simple slides
- Big numbers, clear trends
- One recommendation per slide
- Minimal explanation needed

### For External Marketing
- Highly visual, minimal text
- Emotional resonance important
- Brand consistency critical
- Production quality matters

### For Internal Operations
- Functional over beautiful
- Common templates aid efficiency
- Density acceptable if team is aligned
- Still: clear point, even if slide is utilitarian

## AI Integration Notes

### Context Signals That Trigger This SOP
- User is creating or editing presentation slides
- User mentions audience confusion or information overload
- User asks how many slides to include
- User struggling to organize information visually
- User mentions presentation feels cluttered or unclear
- User preparing different types of presentations (keynote vs. meeting vs. doc)

### How to Adapt for Different Situations
- **For novice presenters**: Emphasize the basic rule strictly - truly one point only
- **For experienced presenters**: Discuss contextual variations and when density is acceptable
- **For technical presentations**: Acknowledge that "one point" can be complex architecture, but still singular focus
- **For marketing/sales**: Emphasize emotional clarity and visual simplicity
- **For data-heavy contexts**: One point might be "here are the three key metrics" but hierarchy must be clear
- **For remote presentations**: Extra simplicity needed (harder to see detail on small screens)

### Limitations and Edge Cases
- Some cultures expect denser slides (research your context)
- Academic presentations often have different norms
- Compliance/legal contexts may require specific density
- Appendix/reference slides can be denser (not part of main flow)
- Workshop slides meant for collaboration different than presentation slides
- Handouts vs. projection slides have different requirements
- Some audiences explicitly want "leave-behind" density (create slide doc version)
- Real-time data dashboards have different purpose than persuasive presentations
- The "one point" can encompass a framework with multiple components, as long as it's unified
