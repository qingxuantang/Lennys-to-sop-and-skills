# Four Forces Demand Analysis

## Metadata
- **Source**: Bob Moesta - Lenny's Podcast
- **Domain**: Customer Research / Product Strategy
- **Type**: Framework SOP
- **Applicable To**: Product Managers, Founders, Marketers, Sales
- **Company Stage**: All stages
- **Difficulty**: Beginner to Intermediate

## Overview
The Four Forces framework explains why customers switch (or don't switch) between products. By understanding the forces pushing them away from their current solution and pulling them toward a new one—balanced against anxiety and habit—you can design products, marketing, and sales processes that enable purchase rather than trying to convince customers.

## When to Use
- Designing product onboarding to reduce friction
- Creating marketing messages that resonate
- Understanding why deals stall or fail
- Reducing churn
- Prioritizing feature development
- Pricing strategy
- Sales enablement

## Prerequisites
- Basic understanding of your customer
- Access to customer feedback or interviews
- Willingness to see from customer perspective

## The Four Forces Framework

### The System of Progress

```
                    CHANGE
                       ↑
     F1: PUSH ─────────┼───────── F2: PULL
     (Context)         │         (Outcome)
                       │
         ━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━ ← Threshold
                       │
     F4: HABIT ────────┼────────── F3: ANXIETY
     (Present)         │          (New)
                       ↓
                    NO CHANGE
```

**The equation:**
- If (F1 + F2) > (F3 + F4) → Customer switches
- If (F1 + F2) < (F3 + F4) → Customer stays

## Procedure

### Step 1: Identify the Push (F1)

**What's happening in their current situation that creates discomfort?**

**Components:**
- Specific events/triggers
- Context they're in
- Problems with current approach
- Frustrations building up

**Example questions:**
- "What wasn't working?"
- "What happened that made today the day?"
- "What changed in your situation?"

**Key insight:** The push has NOTHING to do with your product. It's entirely about their current state.

**Example (CRM purchase):**
- Team grew from 3 to 10 people
- Spreadsheet became chaos
- Lost a major deal due to dropped follow-up
- Boss asked "why don't we have a system?"

### Step 2: Identify the Pull (F2)

**What outcome are they hoping to achieve?**

**Three dimensions:**
1. **Functional**: What they want to accomplish
2. **Emotional**: How they want to feel
3. **Social**: How they want others to perceive them

**Example questions:**
- "What were you hoping would be different?"
- "What would success look like?"
- "How did you want to feel after?"

**Key insight:** Pull is not your product's features—it's the better life they imagine.

**Example (CRM purchase):**
- Functional: Track all deals in one place
- Emotional: Feel in control, not anxious
- Social: Look professional to prospects

### Step 3: Identify the Anxiety (F3)

**What fears or uncertainties make them hesitate?**

**Common anxieties:**
- "Will this actually work?"
- "Can I learn it?"
- "What if we pick wrong?"
- "What will people think?"
- "How much will this really cost?"

**Key insight:** Adding more features often INCREASES anxiety. Simpler products reduce it.

**Ways to reduce anxiety:**
- Free trials
- Money-back guarantees
- Case studies from similar companies
- Simple onboarding
- Low commitment entry points

**Example (CRM purchase):**
- "Our team won't adopt it"
- "Data migration will be a nightmare"
- "It'll take months to set up"

### Step 4: Identify the Habit (F4)

**What are they comfortable with that they'd have to give up?**

**Components:**
- Learned behaviors
- Invested time/money
- Familiar workflows
- Team training already done
- "The way we've always done it"

**Key insight:** Never underestimate habit. People use terrible solutions forever because they're familiar.

**Ways to overcome habit:**
- Make migration easy
- Support parallel running
- Import existing data
- Match familiar workflows initially
- Lower the cost of switching

**Example (CRM purchase):**
- Know every spreadsheet shortcut
- Years of historical data in current format
- Team knows where to find everything
- Custom formulas and workarounds

### Step 5: Calculate the Balance

**Map the forces for your specific situation:**

| Force | What We Know | Strength (1-10) |
|-------|--------------|-----------------|
| F1: Push | | |
| F2: Pull | | |
| F3: Anxiety | | |
| F4: Habit | | |

**If F1+F2 = F3+F4:** Customer is stuck, won't decide
**If F1+F2 < F3+F4:** Customer won't change
**If F1+F2 > F3+F4:** Customer will change

### Step 6: Design Interventions

**To increase change, you can:**

1. **Amplify Push (F1)**:
   - Help them see problems they're ignoring
   - Show cost of inaction
   - Create urgency (carefully)

2. **Strengthen Pull (F2)**:
   - Paint a vivid picture of outcome
   - Show similar customers who succeeded
   - Demonstrate value quickly

3. **Reduce Anxiety (F3)**:
   - Simplify the product
   - Add guarantees
   - Offer trials/pilots
   - Provide hand-holding

4. **Lower Habit Barrier (F4)**:
   - Easy migration
   - Training included
   - Match existing workflows
   - Let old system run parallel

**Key insight:** Most companies focus only on F2 (adding features/pull). The biggest opportunities are often in reducing F3 and F4.

## Application: Product Design

**When a feature fails:**
- Did we create more anxiety than value?
- Did we break established habits?
- Is the context (push) actually present?

**When conversion is low:**
- What anxieties exist at decision point?
- What habits are we asking them to break?
- Is our pull strong enough for their push?

## Application: Reducing Friction

**Real example (condo sales):**

**Problem:** Customers canceled 6 weeks after purchase
**Analysis:** F4 (habit) too strong—didn't know how to deal with moving

**Solution:**
- Raised price of condo
- Included moving AND 2 years storage
- Addressed the friction directly

**Result:** 30% increase in sales

## Expected Outcomes
- Clear understanding of why customers do/don't buy
- Prioritized friction reduction opportunities
- Better onboarding design
- More effective messaging
- Reduced churn
- Shorter sales cycles

## Common Pitfalls

### Only focusing on pull (features)
- More features = more anxiety
- Often need to SUBTRACT, not add

### Ignoring status quo competition
- 40% of B2B deals lost to "no decision"
- The spreadsheet is your real competitor

### Assuming everyone has the same push
- Different contexts = different jobs
- Segment by struggling moment, not demographics

### Underestimating habit
- People will use terrible solutions forever if familiar
- The devil you know...

## AI Integration Notes

### Context signals that should trigger this SOP:
- User mentions "conversion," "why won't they buy"
- Discussion of feature prioritization
- Churn analysis
- Sales cycle length concerns

### How to adapt:
- For enterprise sales: F3 (anxiety) is often largest force
- For consumer: F4 (habit) often dominates
- For startups: Focus on reducing F3+F4, not adding F2

### The key question:
"What would someone have to believe to switch from their current solution to ours?"
