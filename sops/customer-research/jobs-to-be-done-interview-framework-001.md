## Overview
Jobs to Be Done (JTBD) is a framework for understanding why customers hire products to make progress in their lives. This SOP provides the method for conducting JTBD interviews to uncover the struggling moments, forces, and trade-offs that drive customer behavior.

## When to Use
- Building a new product from scratch (zero to one)
- Trying to understand why customers buy (or don't)
- High churn and need to understand why
- Product-market fit seems off
- Need to identify true competitive alternatives
- Prioritizing features or capabilities
- Developing sales and marketing messaging

## Prerequisites
- Access to people who recently purchased (your product or competitor's)
- 10-12 interview slots (30-60 minutes each)
- Recording capability
- Framework understanding (Four Forces)

## Core Concept: The Four Forces

Before interviewing, understand the four forces that drive all purchase decisions:

```
         FORCES DRIVING CHANGE
         ┌─────────────────────┐
F1: Push │ Situation/Context   │──┐
         │ (Problems with      │  │
         │  current state)     │  │
         └─────────────────────┘  │
                                   ├──► SWITCH
F2: Pull ┌─────────────────────┐  │
         │ Desired Outcome     │──┘
         │ (Attraction to new) │
         └─────────────────────┘

         FORCES RESISTING CHANGE
         ┌─────────────────────┐
F3:      │ Anxiety of New      │──┐
Anxiety  │ (Fear, uncertainty) │  │
         └─────────────────────┘  │
                                   ├──► STAY
F4:      ┌─────────────────────┐  │
Habit    │ Habit of Present    │──┘
         │ (Comfort, inertia)  │
         └─────────────────────┘
```

**Key insight**: F1 + F2 must be greater than F3 + F4 for change to happen.

## Procedure

### Step 1: Frame the Research Question

Define what you want to learn:
- "What causes people to buy [product category]?"
- "What causes people to switch from [competitor] to [us]?"
- "What causes people to churn from [our product]?"

**Don't ask**: "What features do you want?"
**Do ask**: "What was happening that made you look for something new?"

### Step 2: Recruit Recent Purchasers

**Who to interview:**
- People who RECENTLY made a purchase/switch (within 30-90 days)
- Not prospects or "want to" buyers - only people who DID
- 10-12 interviews (patterns emerge by 7-8)

**If you don't have customers yet:**
Interview people who bought competitor products to understand:
- What they were replacing
- Why they switched
- What jobs they hired the product for

### Step 3: Conduct the Interview

**DO NOT use a discussion guide.** Use the Four Forces framework to guide organic conversation.

**Opening questions:**
- "Tell me about the moment you decided to [buy/switch]"
- "What was happening in your life/business that made today the day?"
- "Take me back to when you first thought about this"

**Key technique: Follow the energy**
- When they say something interesting, dig deeper
- "Tell me more about that"
- "Give me an example"
- "What do you mean by [vague word]?"

**The timeline approach:**
Map out their buying journey:
1. First thought (when did the idea first enter their mind?)
2. Passive looking (aware of problem, not yet solution)
3. Active looking (researching, comparing)
4. Deciding (making trade-offs)
5. First use
6. Ongoing use

### Step 4: Uncover Each Force

**F1 - Push (Context/Struggling Moment):**
- "What wasn't working about what you had before?"
- "What happened that made you say 'I need to do something'?"
- Look for: Specific events, frustrations, triggers

**F2 - Pull (Desired Outcome):**
- "What were you hoping would be different?"
- "What did you want to be true after?"
- Look for: Desired emotional, functional, and social outcomes

**F3 - Anxiety:**
- "What worried you about making this change?"
- "What almost stopped you from switching?"
- Look for: Fears, uncertainties, "what ifs"

**F4 - Habit:**
- "What did you have to give up?"
- "What were you used to that you had to change?"
- Look for: Comfort, familiarity, learned behaviors

### Step 5: Get Past the Pablum Layer

**Three layers of language:**
1. **Pablum**: "It was good" / "I needed something better" (surface)
2. **Fantasy/Nightmare**: Exaggerated, emotional (push past this too)
3. **Reality**: Specific, detailed, contextual (target this)

**Techniques:**
- Play back incorrectly to get them to correct you
- Say "No" (forces elaboration more than "Yes")
- Push to the "edge of language" where they struggle to explain
- Then bracket: "Was it more about X or more about Y?"

### Step 6: Identify Hire and Fire Criteria

**What made them choose YOUR product over alternatives?**
- "What made you pick this over [competitor]?"
- "What was the deciding factor?"
- "What trade-offs did you make?"

**What would make them leave?**
- "What would have to change for you to look elsewhere?"
- "What could go wrong that would make this not work?"

### Step 7: Analyze and Cluster

**Don't look for themes - look for patterns (sets)**

**Cluster based on:**
- Similar pushes that connect to similar pulls
- Similar anxieties and habits
- Similar trade-offs

**Output:** 3-5 distinct "jobs" your product is hired for

**Key insight:** Each job represents a different competitive set. Snickers competes with protein bars (meal replacement job), not Milky Way (comfort job).

## Interview Tips

### DO:
- Record everything (with permission)
- Interview individually, not groups
- Let silence do the work
- Follow surprising responses
- Get specific ("Tell me about the last time...")
- Read "Never Split the Difference" for techniques

### DON'T:
- Use a rigid discussion guide
- Ask "why" directly (feels confrontational)
- Accept "random" or "lucky" as explanation
- Interview people who just want/plan to buy
- Group interviews together before you finish

## Expected Outcomes
- 3-5 distinct jobs your product is hired for
- Clear understanding of competitive alternatives (from demand side)
- Insights into anxieties and friction to reduce
- Language customers actually use
- Understanding of the switching trigger

## Common Pitfalls

### Sitting in a conference room hypothesizing jobs
- 100% of hypothesized jobs are wrong
- You MUST talk to real customers who switched

### Interviewing people who "want to buy"
- "Bitchin' ain't switchin'"
- Only talk to people who DID something

### Following best users
- They'll pull you upmarket and away from core
- Study struggling moments, not power users

### Focusing only on pain
- JTBD is context + outcome, not just pain
- Context makes irrational behavior rational

## Related SOPs
- Four Forces Analysis Template
- Switching Interview Guide
- Churn Investigation Framework

## AI Integration Notes

### Context signals that should trigger this SOP:
- User mentions "customer interviews," "user research"
- Questions about "why customers buy"
- Building new products
- Churn analysis
- Competitive positioning

### How to adapt:
- For enterprise: Interview the "champion" in the buying process
- For churn: Focus on what changed in their context
- For new products: Interview users of competitive alternatives

### Key insight:
Jobs to Be Done reveals that people don't buy products - they hire them to make progress. The context (where they start) matters as much as the outcome (where they want to go).
