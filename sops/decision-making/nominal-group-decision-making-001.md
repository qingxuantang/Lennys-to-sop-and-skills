# Nominal Group Decision Making

## Metadata
- **Source**: Annie Duke - Lenny's Podcast
- **Domain**: Decision Making
- **Type**: Framework SOP
- **Applicable To**: All roles, especially leaders running meetings
- **Company Stage**: All stages
- **Difficulty**: Beginner

## Overview
Group decisions suffer from cross-influence, confidence bias, and loudest-voice problems. The Nominal Group method separates "Discover, Discuss, Decide" so that discovery and decisions happen independently while discussion happens in a group. The key insight: **the only thing that should happen in a meeting is discussion — discovery of opinions and final decisions should happen independently and asynchronously**.

## When to Use
- Any group decision-making process
- Brainstorming sessions
- Forecasting and estimation
- Project planning
- Investment decisions
- Prioritization discussions

## Prerequisites
- Multiple people involved in decision
- Ability to collect input asynchronously
- Meeting facilitator
- Shared documentation tools

## Core Concept: Discover, Discuss, Decide

### The Traditional (Flawed) Approach
All three activities happen in the same meeting:

**Discovery**: "What do you think about X?"
**Discussion**: Debating different views
**Decision**: Arriving at conclusion

**Problems with this approach:**
- Loudest voice wins
- First opinion anchors others
- Conformity pressure
- Not everyone speaks
- Senior people bias juniors
- Confident ≠ correct

### The Nominal Group Approach
Separate the three activities:

| Activity | When | How |
|----------|------|-----|
| **Discover** | Before meeting | Independent, asynchronous input |
| **Discuss** | In meeting | Group discussion of pre-submitted views |
| **Decide** | After discussion | Independent vote or single decision-maker |

**Key insight:**
> "If I'm senior and I say 'I think this is going to take three months' and you were thinking four weeks, you're never going to hear four weeks from me, ever. But if we get those opinions independently, you will actually hear that I think four weeks."

## Procedure

### Step 1: Identify What Needs Input
Before scheduling a meeting, clarify what you need to discover.

**Examples:**
- What features should we prioritize?
- How long will this project take?
- Should we pursue this opportunity?
- What are the risks we should consider?

**Formulate specific questions:**
- Not: "What do you think?"
- Yes: "Rank these 5 priorities from most to least important with rationale"
- Yes: "Estimate how many sprints this will take (lower bound, point estimate, upper bound)"
- Yes: "List the top 3 risks you see with this approach"

### Step 2: Collect Input Independently
Gather opinions before the meeting without cross-influence.

**Collection methods:**
| Method | When to Use |
|--------|-------------|
| Email/Slack (reply only to you) | Simple input |
| Google Forms | Structured input that dumps to hidden spreadsheet |
| Airtable/Coda with permissions | Recurring decisions, permanent record |
| Anonymous survey | Sensitive topics |

**Instructions to participants:**
> "Please respond to me directly. Don't reply-all or discuss with others before submitting. I'll aggregate all responses before our meeting."

**What to collect:**
- Their answer/opinion
- Brief rationale (3-5 sentences)
- Confidence level (optional)
- Questions they have (optional)

### Step 3: Aggregate and Share Before Meeting
Compile all input and distribute before the meeting.

**Aggregation format:**
```
Question: How long will Feature X take?

Responses (anonymized or attributed):
- Person A: 3 sprints — "Because of dependency on API team"
- Person B: 6 sprints — "Similar feature took 6 last year"
- Person C: 2 sprints — "If we use existing library"

Spread: 2-6 sprints
Average: 3.7 sprints
```

**Pre-meeting instruction:**
> "Please review the aggregated responses before our meeting. Come prepared to discuss, especially where you disagree with others."

### Step 4: Run Discussion Meeting
Focus the meeting on discussion, especially disagreements.

**Meeting structure:**
1. Brief recap of the question and responses (2 min)
2. Ask each person to explain their view (no interruptions)
3. Facilitator reflects back: "What I heard you say is..."
4. Focus on disagreements: "Person A and C are 4 sprints apart — let's understand why"
5. Allow clarifying questions only: "I have a question" = "I don't understand"

**Facilitator rules:**
- Don't share your own opinion
- Reflect back what others say without judgment
- Call on quieter people
- Prevent interruptions
- Focus time on disagreements, not agreements

**Key phrase:**
> "Let me make sure I understand what you're saying..." (then reflect back)

### Step 5: Make Decision Independently
After discussion, decide outside the meeting.

**Decision options:**
| Method | When to Use |
|--------|-------------|
| Single decision-maker | One person has final authority |
| Independent vote | Collect votes without seeing others' votes |
| Majority vote | If needed, but avoid if possible |

**Key insight:**
> "Alignment doesn't exist. You have 10 people in a room and they're all really different people with different opinions, and they're never going to come out of the room agreeing with each other."

**Instead of alignment, aim for:**
- Everyone felt heard
- Everyone understands the decision
- Everyone can support execution even if they disagreed

**Use "Nevertheless":**
> "I've heard everyone's input and I understand there's disagreement. Nevertheless, we're going to do X. Here's why, and I appreciate everyone's contribution to the discussion."

### Step 6: Document and Close
Record the decision and rationale.

**Documentation template:**
```
Decision: [What was decided]
Date: [When]
Decision-maker: [Who]
Input received from: [List]
Key factors in decision: [Why]
Dissenting views considered: [What alternatives were weighed]
```

## On-the-Fly Application

You can apply this even without advance preparation.

**When a topic comes up in a meeting:**
> "Stop. Before we discuss, everyone take out a piece of paper and write down your estimate/opinion. Don't share yet."

**Wait 2-3 minutes, then collect.**

This prevents anchoring from whoever speaks first.

## Expected Outcomes
- More diverse opinions surfaced
- Quieter voices heard equally
- Better calibrated estimates
- Reduced groupthink
- More buy-in despite disagreement
- Better decisions

## Common Pitfalls

### Skipping independent collection
- "Let's just discuss it"
- First opinion anchors everyone
- Diverse views suppressed
- Always collect independently first

### Trying to achieve "alignment"
- Meetings become coercive
- People agree to end discussion
- Real opinions hidden
- Accept disagreement, decide anyway

### Facilitator sharing opinion
- Biases the room
- People conform to leader
- Stay neutral as facilitator
- Share opinion only if you're the decision-maker, after hearing others

### Not focusing on disagreement
- 80% of time confirming agreement
- Missing the valuable signal
- Focus discussion time on differences
- Agreement doesn't need much air time

### Deciding in the meeting
- Pressure to conform
- Anchoring to recent speaker
- Vote independently after meeting
- Or have single decision-maker decide later

## AI Integration Notes

### Context signals that should trigger this SOP:
- "How should we decide this?"
- "Meeting to figure out X"
- "We need alignment on..."
- Group decision processes

### How to apply:
- Identify what needs input
- Design independent collection
- Structure discussion around disagreements
- Separate decision from discussion

### Key insight:
Group meetings are for discussion, not discovery or decision. Collect opinions independently before the meeting to prevent cross-influence, focus the meeting on understanding disagreements, and make the actual decision independently afterward. This surfaces better information and leads to better decisions.
