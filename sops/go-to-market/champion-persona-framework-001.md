## Metadata
- **Source**: April Dunford - Lenny's Podcast
- **Domain**: Go-to-Market / Sales
- **Type**: Framework SOP
- **Applicable To**: Product Marketers, Sales Teams, Product Managers
- **Company Stage**: Growth to Scale (0.5 to 2.0)
- **Difficulty**: Intermediate

## Overview
In B2B sales, 5-7 people are typically involved in a purchase decision, but only one person truly matters for positioning: the **Champion**. The key insight: **if your positioning doesn't crush it with the Champion, you don't even get on the shortlist**.

## When to Use
- Building personas for B2B products
- Developing sales narrative
- Creating marketing content
- Training sales teams
- Product positioning work
- Campaign targeting

## Prerequisites
- Understanding of typical B2B buying process
- Knowledge of who's involved in purchase decisions
- Access to customer research
- Sales team input

## Core Concept: The Champion

### What is a Champion?
The Champion is the person in the account who:
- Gets assigned to evaluate solutions
- Does the research and due diligence
- Creates the shortlist of vendors
- Owns the evaluation process
- Builds consensus across stakeholders
- Sells the decision internally to get buy-in

### Champions vs. Other Personas

**The Champion (Evaluator):**
- Does the work of finding solutions
- Needs to justify their choice to others
- Must build consensus
- Is the gatekeeper

**The Economic Buyer (Decision-Maker):**
- Signs the check
- Delegates evaluation to Champion
- Trusts Champion's recommendation
- Champion sells to them

**End Users:**
- Will use the product day-to-day
- Consulted by Champion
- Concerns addressed by Champion
- Rarely drive the decision

**IT/Security/Legal:**
- Have requirements that must be met
- Champion gathers their requirements
- Can veto, but don't select
- Champion manages their concerns

**Other Stakeholders:**
- Various people involved
- Champion builds consensus with them
- Their input flows through Champion

## Procedure

### Step 1: Identify Your Champion Persona
Find the person who owns the evaluation.

**Questions to ask:**
- Who gets assigned to "figure out" solutions?
- Who creates the shortlist of vendors?
- Who schedules the sales calls?
- Who does the demo requests?

**Common Champion titles (varies by product):**
| Product Type | Typical Champion |
|--------------|------------------|
| CRM | Sales Ops Manager |
| Marketing Automation | Marketing Ops/Demand Gen Manager |
| Developer Tools | Engineering Manager/Tech Lead |
| Security Products | Security Analyst/Architect |
| HR Software | HR Manager/Director |

**Key insight:** Champions are usually mid-level. Executives delegate; Champions execute.

### Step 2: Understand the Champion's Journey
Map how Champions make decisions.

**Typical Champion journey:**
1. **Trigger**: Executive or team pain point surfaces
2. **Assignment**: "John, go figure out what we should do"
3. **Research**: Google, peers, analysts, reviews
4. **Shortlist**: Narrow to 3-5 options
5. **Evaluation**: Sales calls, demos, trials
6. **Recommendation**: Present choice to stakeholders
7. **Consensus**: Get buy-in from all parties
8. **Purchase**: Finalize with Economic Buyer

**Champion's core problem:**
- Must justify choice to smart, skeptical people
- Can't just say "I liked the rep"
- Needs a defensible rationale
- Risks looking bad if choice is wrong

### Step 3: Build Deep Champion Understanding
Go beyond demographics to motivations.

**Champion profile elements:**

**Context:**
- What problem did they inherit?
- Why is this urgent now?
- What have they tried before?

**Goals:**
- Make a good decision for the company
- Look competent to their boss
- Not waste everyone's time
- Get consensus efficiently

**Fears:**
- Making the wrong choice
- Looking uninformed
- Having the decision reversed
- Vendor causing problems later

**Information needs:**
- How is this different from alternatives?
- Why is this the right choice for us specifically?
- What will I tell my boss/IT/users?
- How do I defend this choice?

### Step 4: Arm the Champion
Give Champions what they need to win internally.

**The Champion's toolkit:**
Champions need ammunition to sell internally. Provide:

1. **Clear differentiation:**
   - "We're different because X, Y, Z"
   - Why this matters for your specific situation
   - Easy to articulate to others

2. **Objection answers:**
   - What will IT ask? Here's the answer.
   - What will the CFO ask? Here's the answer.
   - What will end users ask? Here's the answer.

3. **Validation:**
   - Customers like you who chose us
   - Third-party validation (analysts, reviews)
   - Data that supports the decision

4. **Simple narrative:**
   - One-sentence explanation of what you are
   - One-sentence explanation of why you're best for them
   - Story they can retell

**Example for CRM:**
> "Sales ops manager at a 50-person company evaluating CRMs. Needs to tell VP Sales why they picked us over Salesforce. Give them: 'We chose X because it's designed for growing teams — has 80% of Salesforce features at 20% of the complexity and cost. Companies like Y and Z switched for this reason.'"

### Step 5: Test with Real Champions
Validate your approach with actual evaluators.

**Testing questions:**
- Does this story resonate when you hear it?
- Would you be comfortable presenting this to your boss?
- What questions would your stakeholders have?
- Does this give you what you need to build consensus?

**Iterate based on:**
- Where do Champions struggle to explain?
- What objections come up in consensus-building?
- What additional information do they need?
- Where do deals stall?

### Step 6: Build Champion-Centric Content
Create content that helps Champions succeed.

**High-value Champion content:**
- Comparison guides (us vs. alternatives)
- ROI calculators
- Implementation guides
- Customer case studies (matching their profile)
- "How to sell internally" guides

**Sales deck structure:**
- Help Champion understand market landscape
- Clearly position where you fit
- Arm them with differentiation points
- Give them the narrative to retell

**Avoid:**
- Content that only talks to Economic Buyer
- Generic content that doesn't acknowledge their role
- Features without "so what"
- Missing objection-handling content

## Expected Outcomes
- Higher shortlist inclusion rates
- Faster deal cycles (Champion is prepared)
- Better win rates
- Fewer deals lost to "no decision"
- Champions become advocates

## Common Pitfalls

### Building too many personas equally
- IT persona, User persona, CFO persona...
- All treated as equal priority
- Champion gets diluted
- Focus: Champion is 10x more important

### Targeting the Economic Buyer directly
- "Let's go straight to the VP"
- VP delegates to Champion anyway
- Champion not armed to recommend you
- Better to win Champion, Champion wins VP

### Forgetting Champions need to sell internally
- You pitch the Champion
- Champion nods and understands
- But Champion can't retell the story
- Give Champion the words and tools

### Creating content only for end users
- "Features that users will love"
- But users don't make the decision
- Champion makes the shortlist
- Champion needs different content

### Ignoring that Champions need to look smart
- Champion's reputation is on the line
- Bad choice = Champion looks bad
- Give Champion confidence and validation
- Help them be the hero

### How to apply:
- Identify the Champion role specifically
- Focus persona work on Champion first

- Create Champion arming content

### Key insight:
In B2B, 5-7 people are involved in a decision, but one person determines if you get on the shortlist. Nail the Champion, and the Champion nails everyone else.
