- **Difficulty**: Intermediate

## Overview
Your current users are not your next users. As products grow, the people joining tomorrow are fundamentally different from those who joined yesterday. The Adjacent User Theory states: **your growth comes from users just outside your current user base, and you must understand what's not working for them — not optimize for existing users**. The key insight: **if you're only dogfooding as a power user, you're blind to why growth is slowing**.

## When to Use
- Growth is slowing despite product improvements
- Cohort curves declining over time
- Expanding to new markets/demographics
- Retention curves show unexpected drops
- Product "isn't working" in new segments

## Prerequisites
- User segmentation data
- Ability to identify churned/bounced users
- Access to new user research
- Willingness to experience product as a new user

## Core Concept: The Adjacent User

### What is an Adjacent User?
The person who could be using your product but for some reason it doesn't work for them.

**Adjacent user characteristics:**
- Just outside your current user base
- Has the need your product serves
- Tried or considered your product
- Something prevented adoption/retention
- Will become your user if you fix their blockers

**Visual representation:**
```
[Current Users] → [Adjacent Users] → [Broader Market]
      ↑                  ↑                   ↑
   Optimize          Growth comes         Future
   here for         from understanding    opportunity
   retention        these users
```

### Why Power Users Blind You

**The problem:**
When you use your own product daily as a power user:
- Your history informs your experience
- Algorithms are optimized for you
- Features are familiar
- You've learned workarounds
- Edge cases are invisible

**What you miss:**
> "A power user who's using a product has so much history and informed knowledge... if you were to go and create a new Gmail account and look at YouTube today, I guarantee you it's a completely different and significantly worse experience."

### Signs Your Adjacent User is Different

**Data signals:**
- Cohort retention curves declining
- Same product, worse metrics for new users
- New market metrics lag established markets
- "Nothing changed but metrics got worse"

**Example (Instagram):**
> "We always knew working on our registration flow, at one point we were converting at some insanely high percent, and then three months later it would go down by 15%, not because anything was broken, but just because we'd broken into new markets."

## Procedure

### Step 1: Identify Your Adjacent User Segments
Map who is just outside your current users.

**Adjacent user dimensions:**
| Dimension | Current User | Adjacent User |
|-----------|--------------|---------------|
| Tech savvy | Early adopter | Late majority |
| Geography | US/EU | Emerging markets |
| Use case | Primary job | Secondary job |
| Demographics | Core demo | Expanding demo |
| Device | Latest phone | Older/cheaper device |

**Questions to identify adjacent users:**
- Who is trying our product but not converting?
- Who signed up but churned quickly?
- Who is our product "not quite right" for?
- What markets are we expanding into?
- What new use cases are emerging?

### Step 2: Quantify the Adjacent User Problem
Measure how different adjacent users are.

**Metrics to compare:**
| Metric | Current Users | Adjacent Users | Gap |
|--------|---------------|----------------|-----|
| Sign-up conversion | X% | Y% | X-Y |
| Day 1 retention | X% | Y% | X-Y |
| Week 1 activation | X% | Y% | X-Y |
| Month 1 retention | X% | Y% | X-Y |

**Cohort analysis:**
- Compare early cohorts to recent cohorts
- Look for degradation in key metrics
- Identify where in funnel gaps emerge
- Track by segment (market, demographic, etc.)

### Step 3: Experience Product as Adjacent User
Dogfood your product from their perspective.

**How to do this:**
1. Create a brand new account
2. Use a different device (older phone, different OS)
3. Simulate their context (new market, limited data)
4. Don't use power-user knowledge
5. Document every friction point

**What to observe:**
- What's confusing without prior knowledge?
- What's broken without history/data?
- What assumptions does the product make?
- What's the actual new user experience?

**Example (YouTube):**
> "A lot of the YouTube graph for search is based on what have you watched in the past. But if you don't have a line of search history, then they're not going to do as good of a job."

### Step 4: Talk to Adjacent Users Directly
Research what's actually preventing adoption.

**Research methods:**
| Method | When to Use |
|--------|-------------|
| User interviews | Deep understanding of blockers |
| Usability testing | Observe actual behavior |
| Survey bounced users | Quantify reasons for leaving |
| In-market research | Understand new geography/demo |
| Support ticket analysis | Find common friction points |

**Questions to ask:**
- What were you trying to do?
- What made you decide to try our product?
- What was confusing or frustrating?
- What would have made you stay?
- What alternatives did you consider?

### Step 5: Map Adjacent User Needs
Identify the gaps between current and adjacent users.

**Gap analysis template:**
| Current User Need | Adjacent User Need | Product Gap |
|-------------------|-------------------|-------------|
| Find friends who use app | Find anyone they know | Graph is celebrity-heavy |
| Fast checkout | Understand shipping costs | Hidden fees |
| Quick content | Relevant content without history | Cold start problem |

**Example (Instagram Connection Pivot):**
> "Early Instagram was built where every follow was created equal... celebrities would get a follow before an average person. But the regular person wasn't having a great experience... when they went to make their first post, none of their friends were following them."

### Step 6: Prioritize Adjacent User Fixes
Address the highest-impact gaps.

**Prioritization criteria:**
1. Size of adjacent user segment
2. Severity of the friction
3. Feasibility of fix
4. Impact on current users (positive or negative)
5. Strategic importance of segment

**Trade-off consideration:**
Sometimes optimizing for adjacent users requires de-prioritizing power users.

**Example:**
> "We had to convince Kevin and Mikey that it was actually not the right thing to prioritize celebrities to everybody because we were basically biting our nose to spank our face, because the regular person wasn't having a great experience."

### Step 7: Continuously Monitor Adjacent Users
Make adjacent user tracking ongoing.

**Ongoing monitoring:**
- Track cohort metrics by segment
- Watch for metric degradation
- Revisit adjacent user research quarterly
- Update product dogfooding regularly
- Build adjacent user consideration into planning

## Application Example: Instagram Connections Pivot

**The discovery:**
Average users retained well initially, then left after 7-9 months.

**Adjacent user insight:**
Users would join, follow celebrities (optimized by algorithm), then make their first post months later — but no friends were following them. They posted into an echo chamber and left.

**The fix:**
- Prioritize human-to-human connections in onboarding
- Still recommend celebrities, but after graph established
- Get friends connected before first post

**Result:**
> "That connection pivot was critical. It literally angle-changed the retention on Instagram. Our retention doubled over the course of a year and a half."

## Expected Outcomes
- Higher conversion in expanding segments
- Better retention for new cohorts
- Sustainable growth trajectory
- Product that scales across segments
- Earlier identification of growth blockers

## Common Pitfalls

### Optimizing only for power users
- Power users give loudest feedback
- Metrics look good for existing base
- Missing why growth is slowing
- Adjacent users silently leave

### Assuming adjacent users are similar
- "They'll figure it out"
- Same product should work
- Context and needs differ dramatically
- Each adjacent segment needs understanding

### One-time adjacent user research
- "We studied new users last year"
- Adjacent users change as you grow
- Yesterday's adjacent user is today's current user
- Continuous monitoring required

### Ignoring geographic/demographic context
- What works in US may not work in India
- Names, payment methods, connectivity differ
- Cultural context matters
- On-the-ground research often necessary

### Not experiencing the product firsthand
- Only reading research reports
- Not feeling the friction yourself
- Abstractions lose visceral understanding
- Personal dogfooding essential

## AI Integration Notes

### Context signals that should trigger this SOP:
- "Growth is slowing"
- "New market metrics are worse"
- "Cohorts degrading"
- Expanding to new segments

### How to apply:
- Identify adjacent user segments
- Experience product as adjacent user
- Research and map their needs
- Prioritize fixes for their blockers

### Key insight:
Your next million users are not like your current million users. The product that acquired your first users will not acquire your next users without adaptation. Growth comes from understanding the adjacent user — the person just outside your current base — and fixing what's not working for them.
