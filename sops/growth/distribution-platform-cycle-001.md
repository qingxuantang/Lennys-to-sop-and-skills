## Overview
The Distribution Platform Cycle explains how platforms evolve through predictable phases, creating and then closing growth opportunities. The key insight: **every distribution channel goes through a cycle from open to closed, and the best growth teams position themselves to exploit these windows before they shut**.

## When to Use
- Evaluating new distribution channels
- Planning platform-dependent growth strategies
- Deciding when to invest in a channel
- Understanding why a channel stopped working
- Building moat-based growth strategies

## Prerequisites
- Understanding of platform dynamics
- Access to channel performance data
- Ability to move quickly when windows open
- Willingness to diversify channels

## Core Concept: The Four-Step Cycle

### Step 0: Conditions for Platform Opening
Before a platform opens, specific conditions must exist.

**Conditions to watch:**
- Platform has saturated easy growth
- Platform needs new value creation
- Regulatory or competitive pressure
- Technology shift enabling new uses
- Platform seeking new revenue streams

**Example (Instagram Reels):**
- TikTok competitive threat
- Need for new content formats
- Creator monetization pressure
- Short-form video demand

### Step 1: Platform Opens + Moat Building
The platform opens and early movers can build defensible positions.

**What happens:**
- New features/APIs become available
- Early adopters get outsized reach
- Platform algorithms favor new formats
- Moats can be established quickly

**Moat types available:**
| Moat Type | Description | Example |
|-----------|-------------|---------|
| Content | Unique valuable content | First newsletters on Substack |
| Audience | First-mover follower base | Early TikTok creators |
| Data | Proprietary insights | Early Facebook app developers |
| Relationships | Platform partnerships | Launch partners |
| Brand | Category ownership | "The X of Y" positioning |

**Key insight:**
> "When a platform opens, the window to build a moat is usually 12-24 months. After that, the moat opportunity closes even if the channel stays open."

### Step 2: Platform Matures
The platform optimizes for its own interests.

**What changes:**
- Algorithm updates favor platform goals
- Organic reach declines
- Pay-to-play increases
- Rules tighten
- Competition increases

**Signs of maturation:**
- Reach/engagement declining with same effort
- Platform pushing paid products
- New policies restricting tactics
- Copycats flooding the space
- Platform building competing features

### Step 3: Platform Closes (or Resets)
The channel becomes commoditized or closes entirely.

**Outcomes:**
| Scenario | What Happens | Strategy |
|----------|--------------|----------|
| Commoditized | Everyone can buy access | Compete on efficiency |
| Closed | Platform restricts access | Diversify or exit |
| Reset | New cycle begins | Position for next opening |
| Displaced | New platform wins | Move to new platform |

## Procedure

### Step 1: Monitor Platform Conditions
Watch for signals that platforms will open.

**Monitoring checklist:**
- [ ] Platform earnings calls and announcements
- [ ] Competitive threats to platform
- [ ] New feature beta programs
- [ ] Developer/creator programs
- [ ] Industry analyst reports
- [ ] Platform employee movements

**Questions to ask:**
- What does this platform need right now?
- Where is the platform feeling competitive pressure?
- What new capabilities are they testing?
- Who are they courting for partnerships?

### Step 2: Evaluate Opening Opportunities
When a platform opens, assess the opportunity.

**Evaluation criteria:**
| Criterion | Questions |
|-----------|-----------|
| Fit | Does this reach our target users? |
| Timing | How long until window closes? |
| Moat potential | Can we build something defensible? |
| Resource requirement | What does it take to win? |
| Downside risk | What if platform closes? |

**Decision framework:**
- High fit + early timing + moat potential → Invest heavily
- High fit + late timing + no moat → Test but don't bet on it
- Low fit → Skip regardless of timing

### Step 3: Build Moat Quickly
When you decide to invest, move fast.

**Moat-building playbook:**
1. **Week 1-4**: Rapid experimentation
   - Test multiple content/format approaches
   - Measure what platform rewards
   - Identify unique angle

2. **Month 2-3**: Double down on winners
   - Scale what works
   - Build audience/following
   - Establish brand presence

3. **Month 4-6**: Solidify moat
   - Create defensible content library
   - Build direct relationships with audience
   - Diversify within platform

4. **Month 6+**: Harvest and hedge
   - Extract value from position
   - Begin diversifying to other channels
   - Watch for platform maturation signs

### Step 4: Prepare for Platform Maturation
Don't be caught off-guard when the platform matures.

**Preparation steps:**
- Capture first-party data (emails, phone numbers)
- Build owned channels (website, app, community)
- Diversify acquisition mix
- Develop paid efficiency early
- Create portable content/assets

**Key insight:**
> "The best time to diversify off a platform is when it's working best for you, not when it starts declining."

### Step 5: Manage the Transition
When the platform matures or closes, execute transition.

**Transition options:**
1. **Efficiency play**: Optimize paid acquisition on mature platform
2. **Migration**: Move audience to owned properties
3. **Platform hop**: Position for next platform cycle
4. **Hybrid**: Maintain presence while diversifying

## Application to AI Distribution (Current Opportunity)

**Current conditions:**
- AI platforms (ChatGPT, Claude, Perplexity) emerging
- Search behavior shifting
- New discovery mechanisms forming
- Platforms seeking content partnerships

**Potential moats:**
- Early content optimization for AI
- Data partnerships with AI companies
- Brand recognition in AI responses
- Unique data AI can't replicate

**Timeline estimate:**
- Platform opening: 2024-2025
- Moat window: 12-24 months
- Maturation: 2026-2027 (speculative)

## Expected Outcomes
- Better timing of channel investments
- More defensible growth positions
- Reduced platform dependency
- Earlier recognition of channel decline
- Sustainable multi-channel growth

## Common Pitfalls

### Entering too late
- Platform already mature
- No moat opportunity
- Competing on efficiency only
- Missing the opening window

### Over-investing in single platform
- All eggs in one basket
- Platform changes hurt badly
- No diversification
- Vulnerable to platform decisions

### Not building moat during opening
- Early but undifferentiated
- Copycats catch up
- No defensible position
- Wasted first-mover advantage

### Ignoring maturation signals
- "It's still working"
- Missing the transition window
- Scrambling when decline hits
- No backup plan

### Building platform-dependent moat only
- Moat that doesn't transfer
- Value locked in platform
- Can't migrate audience
- Limited options when platform closes

## AI Integration Notes

### Context signals that should trigger this SOP:
- "Should we invest in [platform]?"
- "Our [channel] growth is slowing"
- New platform opportunity discussion
- Distribution strategy planning

### How to apply:
- Identify current cycle stage for each platform
- Evaluate moat potential
- Plan for platform maturation
- Develop diversification strategy

### Key insight:
Every platform goes through cycles. The question isn't "Is this channel good?" but "Where is this channel in its cycle?" and "Can we build a moat before the window closes?"
