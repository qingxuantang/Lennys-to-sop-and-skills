## Metadata
- **Source**: Merci Grace (Former Head of Growth at Slack) - Lenny's Podcast
- **Domain**: Growth & GTM Strategy
- **Type**: Framework
- **Applicable To**: Growth Leaders, CEOs, Product Leaders at B2B SaaS companies moving upmarket
- **Company Stage**: Series A+, transitioning from SMB to enterprise
- **Difficulty**: Advanced

## Overview
A strategic framework for transitioning product-led B2B companies from SMB/engineer-driven adoption to enterprise sales motion. Based on Slack's successful upmarket transition, this SOP outlines when and how to introduce sales teams, adapt to enterprise customer expectations, and maintain product-led DNA while scaling into larger accounts.

## When to Use
- Your product has strong SMB/engineer adoption but enterprise companies are expressing interest
- Customers are requesting to speak with salespeople before making larger purchases
- Deal sizes are growing beyond what self-serve motions can capture
- You're seeing organic adoption within enterprise accounts that need expansion support
- You need to capture customer value that exceeds self-serve pricing tiers

## Prerequisites
- Product-market fit with SMB or mid-market customers
- Clear activation metrics and retention patterns
- Understanding of your product's day-zero value proposition
- Existing customer success or support infrastructure
- Basic sales infrastructure (CRM, sales materials)

## Procedure

### Step 1: Recognize Enterprise Customer Signals
Identify when enterprise customers are ready for or requesting sales engagement:

**Key Indicators:**
- Customers asking to speak with someone before purchasing
- Deal sizes exceeding $50K-100K annually
- Enterprise procurement processes requiring vendor conversations
- Multiple departments within large companies adopting your product organically
- Request for custom contracts, security reviews, or compliance documentation

**What to Look For:**
- Customer preference signals (not just your preference for sales-led)
- Companies with formal procurement requirements
- Buyers who expect and want consultative sales support
- Organizations requiring implementation support beyond self-serve

### Step 2: Hire Your First Enterprise Salesperson
Determine the right timing and profile for your first sales hire:

**Timing Signals:**
- You (as founder) are maxed out on sales conversations despite working early mornings and late nights
- You're turning away enterprise customers who want to buy but need sales support
- Deal complexity exceeds what self-serve can handle
- Enterprise customers expect to meet with sales before purchasing

**Ideal First Sales Hire Profile:**
- Experience selling to the customer segment you're targeting (not just any sales experience)
- Comfortable selling a product-led tool (understands that users already love it)
- Can work with customers who prefer consultative engagement
- Excited to work with customers who want to talk to salespeople (sounds obvious but critical)

**Avoid:**
- Hiring sales too early before customer demand signals appear
- Assuming you need sales just because competitors have sales teams
- Hiring traditional enterprise salespeople for SMB product-led motions

### Step 3: Maintain Product-Led DNA While Building Sales
Balance product-led growth with enterprise sales motion:

**Product-Led Expansion Within Enterprise:**
- Use PLG frameworks and tactics to expand within existing enterprise accounts
- Focus on increasing seat count through product virality
- Drive adoption across departments through user-driven spread
- Optimize for retention through product engagement, not just sales touches

**Sales-Assisted PLG Hybrid:**
- Sales captures initial enterprise customer at point of adoption
- Product drives expansion, retention, and cross-departmental spread
- Use sales to navigate procurement, security, and compliance
- Product delivers day-to-day value and drives organic growth

**Key Principle:**
Sales should augment product value, not replace it. The product must still deliver immediate value without sales intervention.

### Step 4: Adapt to Enterprise Customer Expectations
Understand and respect enterprise buying preferences:

**Enterprise Customer Preferences:**
- Want to speak with salespeople before large purchases (respect this preference)
- Require security reviews, compliance documentation, custom contracts
- Need implementation support and success management
- Expect dedicated account management for large deals
- Value consultative guidance on best practices and rollout strategies

**Operational Adaptations:**
- Build security and compliance documentation
- Create enterprise pricing tiers with appropriate support levels
- Establish customer success function for enterprise accounts
- Develop implementation and onboarding services
- Create executive engagement programs for C-level buyers

### Step 5: Design Dual-Track Growth Model
Create systems that support both product-led and sales-led motions:

**Product-Led Track (Bottom-Up):**
- Self-serve signup and activation
- Freemium or trial experiences
- In-product expansion and upgrade prompts
- Viral/referral mechanics for team growth
- Usage-based pricing for smaller customers

**Sales-Led Track (Top-Down/Enterprise):**
- Dedicated sales team for enterprise segments
- Custom pricing and contracting
- Implementation and success management
- Executive relationships and strategic account planning
- Multi-department rollout support

**Integration Points:**
- Product-led adoption signals route to sales (high usage, team size, etc.)
- Sales-sourced customers still get product-led expansion tools
- Unified data on product usage informs sales conversations
- Customer success monitors product engagement across all segments

### Step 6: Scale Sales Without Losing Product-Led Advantages
Maintain product-led efficiency while building enterprise sales:

**Preserve Product-Led Efficiency:**
- Keep self-serve path alive for SMB and mid-market
- Don't gate product features that drive viral adoption
- Maintain low CAC for bottom-up customers
- Continue investing in product-led retention mechanics

**Scale Sales Strategically:**
- Segment sales efforts by deal size and customer complexity
- Use inside sales for mid-market, field sales for enterprise
- Implement sales engineering for technical enterprise deals
- Build sales playbooks based on product usage patterns

**Measure Both Motions:**
- Track product-led metrics (activation, retention, viral coefficient)
- Track sales metrics (deal size, sales cycle, win rate)
- Understand contribution of each motion to revenue
- Optimize for blended CAC and LTV across all channels

## Expected Outcomes
- Successfully capture enterprise customers while maintaining product-led efficiency
- Higher average deal sizes from enterprise segment
- Reduced sales cycle for customers who prefer consultative engagement
- Increased revenue from expansion within enterprise accounts
- Balanced growth model that scales both bottom-up and top-down

## Common Pitfalls

**Pitfall 1: Hiring sales before customer demand signals appear**
- *Avoid*: Building sales team because "that's what enterprise companies do"
- *Instead*: Wait until customers are pulling sales engagement from you
- *Signal*: When you as founder can't handle sales volume or customers request sales conversations

**Pitfall 2: Abandoning product-led motion when adding sales**
- *Avoid*: Gating all features behind sales conversations once you build sales team
- *Avoid*: Requiring sales calls for customers who want self-serve
- *Instead*: Maintain self-serve for customers who prefer it
- *Instead*: Use sales only where customers want or require it

**Pitfall 3: Hiring wrong sales profile**
- *Avoid*: Hiring aggressive "hunter" salespeople for customers who already love the product
- *Avoid*: Hiring traditional enterprise reps who don't understand product-led selling
- *Instead*: Hire salespeople who love working with customers who want to talk to them
- *Instead*: Find reps excited about product-led tools with built-in demand

**Pitfall 4: Not respecting enterprise customer preferences**
- *Avoid*: Assuming all customers should be self-serve
- *Avoid*: Treating desire for sales engagement as friction to eliminate
- *Instead*: Recognize that enterprise buyers often prefer sales consultation
- *Instead*: Build infrastructure to serve enterprise buying preferences

**Pitfall 5: Mismatched sales and product-led metrics**
- *Avoid*: Only measuring sales metrics after adding enterprise motion
- *Avoid*: Ignoring product engagement for sales-sourced customers
- *Instead*: Track both product-led and sales-led contribution
- *Instead*: Use product engagement to inform enterprise sales and expansion

- Maintained product-led expansion within enterprise accounts
- Used sales to navigate procurement and compliance requirements
- Product continued to drive retention and cross-departmental adoption

**Result:**
- Scaled to one of largest B2B companies through hybrid motion
- Preserved low-CAC product-led growth for SMB
- Captured high-LTV enterprise customers through sales
- Achieved efficient blended growth model

## AI Integration Notes

### Context Signals for AI Models
This SOP should be triggered when:
- User asks about moving upmarket or selling to enterprise
- User asks when to hire first salesperson
- User describes customers requesting sales conversations
- User discusses transitioning from PLG to enterprise sales
- User asks about hybrid PLG/sales-led models

### Adaptation Guidance
- For earlier-stage companies: Emphasize waiting for customer demand signals
- For companies already doing sales: Focus on maintaining product-led expansion
- For pure PLG companies: Highlight importance of customer preference, not ideology
- For enterprise-first companies: Explain how to add product-led expansion

### Key Principles to Emphasize
1. Customer preference drives sales decision, not company preference
2. Sales should augment product value, not replace it
3. Enterprise customers often want and expect sales engagement
4. Product-led DNA can coexist with enterprise sales motion
5. The founder is always the first salesperson
