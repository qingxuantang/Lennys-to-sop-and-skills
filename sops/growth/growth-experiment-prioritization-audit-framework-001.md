- **Difficulty**: Intermediate

## Overview
A systematic approach to auditing your PLG funnel and identifying the highest-leverage starting point for growth experiments. This framework helps teams find "low-hanging fruit" opportunities and avoid spreading resources too thin across multiple areas.

## When to Use
- When launching or optimizing a product-led growth motion
- When you have a PLG funnel in place but uncertain where to focus efforts
- After launching free/trial product and ready to optimize conversion
- When you need to demonstrate early wins to build organizational momentum
- During quarterly planning for growth initiatives

## Prerequisites
- A product with some form of free or trial offering
- Basic analytics implementation (can track signups, usage, conversions)
- Ability to act as an end user and go through your own product flow
- Access to funnel metrics (even if incomplete)

## Procedure

### Step 1: Map Your Complete PLG Funnel

**Understand the Two Funnel Types:**

**Sales-Led Funnel (SLG):**
- Marketing brings visitors → Leads (MQLs based on engagement scores)
- Sales qualifies and works leads → Closed deals
- Success indicator: Marketing interaction (emails opened, whitepapers read, webinars attended)

**Product-Led Funnel (PLG):**
- Marketing brings visitors → Free signups/trials
- Users experience product value → Usage-based qualification
- Two conversion paths:
  1. Self-service checkout → Automated revenue
  2. High-value users (PQLs) → Sales engagement → Larger deals

**Key Difference:**
PLG focuses on product usage as the leading indicator, not marketing engagement. Usage drives success.

**Action:** Document your funnel steps:
1. Website visit
2. Signup (free/trial)
3. First product usage
4. Aha moment / Activation
5. Continued usage / Retention
6. Conversion (self-serve OR sales-assisted)

### Step 2: Conduct Full-Funnel User Audit

**Approach: Become Your Own User**

Walk through the entire journey as if you're a semi-interested potential customer:

**Marketing Website Audit:**
- Is value proposition immediately clear?
- Is there a prominent way to try the product (not just "Book Demo")?
- Can you find and understand pricing?
- Does the site attract you and make you want to try?

**Signup Flow Audit:**
- How many steps to get into the product?
- Are questions necessary or friction-adding?
- Do you ask for information you don't need yet?
- How long does it take from landing page to using product?
- Are there unnecessary qualifications that block signups?

**First Use Experience Audit (Critical):**
- When you land in product, is it clear what to do?
- Do you get stuck or confused?
- Are you given a "warm start" (templates, samples, examples)?
- Can you experience value without doing extensive setup?
- How long until you can see the product working?
- Do you hit any walls requiring setup you don't have ready?

**Email Experience Audit:**
- What emails do you receive in first 24 hours, week, month?
- Do emails help get you back to product?
- Do they guide you to high-value actions?
- Are they helpful or annoying?

**Conversion Flow Audit:**
- Can you even find where to buy?
- How many clicks to start checkout?
- Is pricing clear or confusing?
- Are payment options appropriate for your markets?
- Are there unnecessary form fields causing friction?
- Do questions make sense for all geographies? (UK-specific questions asked of US users?)

**Document Everything:**
- Take screenshots of confusing moments
- Note every point where you felt stuck
- Record time taken for each stage
- List assumptions the product makes about you

### Step 3: Gather High-Level Funnel Data

**Request These Metrics (Even Rough Estimates):**

```
Website Visitors: [X per month]
    ↓
Free Signups/Trial Starts: [Y] (conversion rate: Y/X)
    ↓
Activated Users (hit aha moment): [Z] (activation rate: Z/Y)
    ↓
Self-Serve Checkout Starts: [A] (checkout start rate: A/Z)
    ↓
Self-Serve Conversions: [B] (checkout success rate: B/A)
    ↓
PQLs Identified: [C]
    ↓
PQL Conversions: [D] (PQL conversion: D/C)
```

**Identify the Biggest Drops:**
- Where do you lose the most users percentage-wise?
- Where do you lose the most users in absolute numbers?
- Where is your experience vs. data mismatch? (e.g., you thought checkout was fine but 60% drop off)

### Step 4: Identify Your Four Opportunity Buckets

**Bucket 1: Activation (Most Common Starting Point)**

**Why Start Here:**
- Most B2B software isn't designed for quick time-to-value
- Biggest opportunity area for most PLG products
- Users have already overcome many hurdles to get here
- High leverage: Improves both conversion AND retention

**Indicators This Is Your Focus:**
- Large drop-off between signup and first valuable action
- Confusion when landing in product
- Long time to aha moment
- No guided onboarding or warm start

**Examples of Great Activation:**
- Miro: Asks use case, provides templates, gets you creating in 5 minutes
- Products that offer sample data/content to explore immediately

**Bucket 2: Conversion (Self-Service Checkout)**

**Why Start Here:**
- Users are closest to revenue
- Can learn from e-commerce best practices
- Often has obvious, fixable issues
- Quick wins possible

**Indicators This Is Your Focus:**
- High activation but low conversion to paid
- Checkout flow has friction or confusion
- Pricing is complicated
- Payment options don't support all your markets
- Hard to find where to buy

**Goal:** Make buying as easy as Amazon or Lululemon

**Common Issues Found:**
- Confusing forms (asking wrong questions)
- Limited payment options (missing regional preferences)
- Pricing complexity requiring sales quote
- Hidden or hard-to-find upgrade paths

**Bucket 3: Product-Led Acquisition (If You Have Viral Loops)**

**Why Start Here:**
- Highest potential leverage
- Compounds over time
- Lower CAC

**Indicators This Is Your Focus:**
- Product has inherent collaboration features
- Workflow naturally involves inviting others
- Multi-player use cases

**Examples:**
- Figma: Sharing designs for feedback
- Calendly: Sending meeting links spreads the product
- Airtable: Collaborative databases

**Only Prioritize If:** You have natural viral loops built into workflow

**Bucket 4: PQL/Sales-Assisted (Larger Effort)**

**Why Start Here:**
- Targeting high-value accounts
- Blending PLG with sales motion
- Need to close larger deals

**Indicators This Is Your Focus:**
- Activation and self-serve conversion working reasonably well
- Significant volume of users to analyze
- Clear ICP for high-value accounts
- Sales team ready to engage with product-qualified leads

**Don't Start Here If:** You haven't validated activation and basic conversion yet

### Step 5: Apply the Leverage Principle

**Hila's Core Philosophy:** "Doing growth is always about finding leverage"

**Leverage Definition:** Relatively small investment that produces the biggest results

**Selection Criteria:**
1. **Magnitude of Opportunity**: How many users affected? How big is the drop-off?
2. **Ease of Improvement**: Can you fix it quickly? Are issues obvious?
3. **Downstream Effects**: Will this improvement help retention too? Will it compound?
4. **Organizational Learning**: Will this teach you about your users and inform future work?

**The Leverage Framework:**
```
Priority = (Impact × Ease × Downstream Effects) / Effort

High Priority: Activation (usually)
- Affects everyone who signs up
- Often has obvious improvements
- Improves both conversion AND retention
- Teaches you about user needs

Medium Priority: Self-Serve Conversion
- Affects motivated users already
- Often quick wins available
- Direct revenue impact
- Limited downstream effects

Lower Priority (Initially): PQL/Sales
- More complex to implement
- Requires cross-functional coordination
- Should wait until sufficient volume
```

### Step 6: Choose Your Starting Point

**Default Recommendation: Activation**

Start with activation if:
- You have noticeable drop-off between signup and first value
- Time-to-value is long or unclear
- New users report confusion
- Retention is also an issue (activation often helps both)

**Choose Conversion If:**
- Activation metrics are solid (>60% of signups reach aha moment)
- Users love product but aren't converting
- Obvious checkout flow issues identified in audit
- Need quick revenue wins

**Choose Acquisition If:**
- Activation and conversion are working
- You have natural viral mechanics in product
- Team has capacity for longer-term investment

**Choose PQL/Sales Path If:**
- Already have volume and basic funnel working
- Clear ICP for high-value accounts
- Cross-functional team available
- Patient timeline (6-12 months to build)

### Step 7: Define Success Metrics for Focus Area

**For Activation Focus:**
- Primary: % of signups reaching aha moment (define aha moment first)
- Secondary: Time to aha moment
- Tertiary: 7-day/30-day retention
- North Star: Activated users

**For Conversion Focus:**
- Primary: Free-to-paid conversion rate
- Secondary: Checkout completion rate
- Tertiary: Time from trial start to conversion
- North Star: Self-serve revenue

**For Acquisition Focus:**
- Primary: K-factor or viral coefficient
- Secondary: % of users who invite others
- Tertiary: Time to first invite/share
- North Star: Organic signups

**For PQL Focus:**
- Primary: Number of PQLs generated
- Secondary: PQL → Revenue conversion
- Tertiary: Average deal size from PQL
- North Star: Revenue from product-led sales

## Expected Outcomes
- Clear understanding of your complete PLG funnel
- Identified 2-5 major opportunities with estimated impact
- Chosen starting point based on leverage, not intuition
- Documented baseline metrics for focus area
- List of "low-hanging fruit" quick wins
- Organizational alignment on where to start

## Common Pitfalls

### Pitfall 1: Analysis Paralysis
**Problem**: Spending months analyzing without picking a focus
**Solution**: Complete audit in 1-2 weeks maximum, then commit to a starting point

### Pitfall 2: Trying to Fix Everything
**Problem**: Starting experiments across all four buckets simultaneously
**Solution**: Pick ONE focus area, get wins, then expand

### Pitfall 3: Following Trends, Not Data
**Problem**: Focusing on PQLs because it's trendy when activation is broken
**Solution**: Let your audit findings drive prioritization, not industry buzz

### Pitfall 4: Skipping the User Audit
**Problem**: Only looking at data without experiencing the product as a user
**Solution**: Always do the hands-on walkthrough; it reveals issues data can't show

### Pitfall 5: Ignoring Quick Wins
**Problem**: Designing elaborate solutions when simple fixes would work
**Solution**: During audit, flag obvious issues that can be fixed immediately (wrong questions in forms, broken payment options, etc.)

### Pitfall 6: Wrong Leverage Assessment
**Problem**: Picking conversion over activation when 80% of users never activate
**Solution**: Consider both absolute numbers and percentages; fixing an 80% drop is usually higher leverage than optimizing a 10% drop

### Pitfall 7: Missing the "Do, Show, Tell" Hierarchy
**Problem**: Building elaborate tooltips when users need to actually DO something
**Solution**: For activation, prioritize:
  1. DO (give them working thing to try - templates, samples)
  2. SHOW (show them how it works)
  3. TELL (explain with text/tooltips)

## AI Integration Notes

### Context Signals for This SOP
- User mentions: "where to start with growth", "PLG priorities", "growth experiments", "funnel optimization"
- User has free/trial product but unsure of next steps
- User mentions low conversion or activation rates
- User has limited growth resources and needs to focus

### Adaptation Guidance
- **For very early stage**: Emphasize user audit over extensive data analysis (may not have enough data)
- **For B2C products**: Activation is almost always the answer; time-to-value should be minutes, not days
- **For high-complexity B2B**: Accept longer activation windows but still focus on reducing friction
- **For products with strong virality**: May prioritize acquisition earlier than typical

### Key Questions to Ask User
1. Do you have a free/trial product live? How long?
2. What's your current signup-to-paid conversion rate?
3. Have you defined your activation/aha moment?
4. What does your current funnel look like (rough numbers)?
5. Have you personally gone through your own signup and onboarding recently?
6. What do you think your biggest opportunity is? (Then validate with data)

### Limitations
- Assumes B2B SaaS context primarily
- Requires at least some users flowing through funnel to analyze
- Most applicable when you have a funnel in place but need optimization
- Less applicable to pre-launch or pure enterprise sales products
