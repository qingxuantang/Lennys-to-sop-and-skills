- **Difficulty**: Intermediate

## Overview
A comprehensive framework for hiring your first growth PM or head of growth, including sourcing strategies, skill requirements, interview questions, and how to match candidates to your specific starting point in PLG.

## When to Use
- When ready to hire your first dedicated growth person
- When scaling from one growth PM to a growth leader
- When building out growth team and need to assess candidates
- When transitioning someone internal to growth role
- When evaluating agency or advisory support vs. full-time hire

## Prerequisites
- Leadership commitment to PLG (at least 1-2 year roadmap)
- Basic understanding of your PLG funnel and starting point
- Clarity on initial focus area (activation, conversion, PQL, etc.)
- Budget approved for hire
- Understanding that growth PM role differs from traditional PM

## Procedure

### Step 1: Understand the Growth PM Profile

**Core Distinction: Growth PM vs. Traditional PM**

**Traditional PM:**
- Focus: Building features and improving product
- Success: Feature adoption, user satisfaction, product quality
- Metrics: Feature usage, NPS, user engagement
- Approach: User research → Roadmap → Ship features

**Growth PM:**
- Focus: Optimizing funnels and driving conversion
- Success: Conversion rates, user journey optimization, revenue impact
- Metrics: Activation rate, conversion rate, funnel metrics, revenue
- Approach: Data analysis → Hypotheses → Experiments → Iteration

**Critical Difference:**
"Growth PM's way of working is similar to other product managers, but his KPIs are actually more similar to sales and marketing. He's very focused on conversion rate, the journey, the funnel versus the feature specifically itself."

**Core Growth PM Competencies:**

**1. Analytics & Data Fluency (Most Critical)**
- Can write SQL or work with data analysts effectively
- Comfortable with statistical significance and experiment design
- Thinks in funnels, conversion rates, and cohorts
- Uses data to drive decisions, not intuition

**2. Experimentation Mindset**
- Comfortable with failure and iteration
- Designs A/B tests correctly
- Interprets results thoughtfully
- Learns from unexpected outcomes

**3. Technical Enough**
- Understands what's technically feasible
- Can work with engineers on growth experiments
- Knows growth tech stack (analytics, experimentation, lifecycle tools)

**4. Cross-Functional Influence**
- Can work across product, marketing, and sales
- Persuades without authority
- Coordinates stakeholders effectively

**5. User Psychology Understanding**
- Understands behavioral psychology and motivation
- Designs for habit formation
- Reduces friction thoughtfully

**Skills Hierarchy for Growth PM:**
```
Must Have:
- Strong analytical/data skills
- Experimentation experience
- Growth metrics fluency
- Funnel thinking

Nice to Have:
- SQL proficiency
- Prior growth role experience
- Specific area expertise (activation, conversion, etc.)
- Technical background

Optional:
- Engineering degree
- Prior startup experience
- Domain expertise in your industry
```

### Step 2: Decide Internal vs. External Hire

**Internal Hire (Strongly Preferred)**

**Advantages:**
- Knows the product, company, and culture
- Has existing relationships to leverage
- Understands political dynamics
- Can start contributing immediately
- Lower risk of culture mismatch
- Often more committed long-term

**Internal Candidates to Consider:**

**1. Product Manager → Growth PM**
- Has PM skills, needs growth training
- Look for: Analytical mindset, interest in metrics, curiosity about growth
- Can succeed if: Willing to shift from feature-focus to funnel-focus

**2. Data Analyst → Growth PM**
- Has analytical foundation, needs product skills
- Look for: Product intuition, user empathy, desire for ownership
- Can succeed if: Willing to make decisions beyond analysis

**3. Other Analytical Roles**
- Marketing analyst, operations, even investor relations
- Look for: Analytical chops, ability to coordinate resources, strategic thinking
- Can succeed with: External advisor support in areas they lack

**Hila's Example:**
"One client, the head of growth used to be head of investor relations. He reports to CEO and founder. He's very analytical. He hasn't been a PM before, but he can socialize resources within the company to launch experiments. And I, as an advisor, come in and guide him in areas he's not familiar with. We actually drive pretty good results."

**How to Identify Internal Candidates:**
- Who asks the most questions about growth metrics?
- Who naturally thinks about conversion and funnels?
- Who has analytical background and user empathy?
- Who's expressed interest in growth?

**External Hire**

**When Required:**
- No internal candidates with interest or aptitude
- Need specific expertise immediately
- Ready to scale and need senior leadership
- Competition for talent allows external offer

**How to Source:**
- Growth PM communities (Reforge network, GrowthHackers)
- Companies known for strong growth teams (Airbnb, Uber, Dropbox, Figma, Notion)
- PLG-focused companies (Atlassian, GitLab, Miro, etc.)
- Growth agencies and consultancies (might get experienced practitioner wanting full-time role)

### Step 3: Match Hire to Your Starting Point

**Critical Principle:** "Map the initial growth PM hire to your starting point"

**If Starting Focus = Activation:**
- Prioritize: Experience improving onboarding and time-to-value
- Look for: Understanding of user psychology, onboarding design
- Ask about: Specific activation experiments they've run
- Red flag: Only has acquisition or paid marketing experience

**If Starting Focus = Conversion:**
- Prioritize: Experience optimizing checkout flows and pricing
- Look for: E-commerce thinking, friction reduction skills
- Ask about: Self-service conversion experiments and results
- Red flag: No experience with conversion funnels, only top-of-funnel

**If Starting Focus = Acquisition:**
- Prioritize: Experience with growth loops, viral mechanics, or paid acquisition
- Look for: Understanding of CAC, LTV, payback period
- Ask about: Channels they've tested, scaling strategies
- Red flag: Only has bottom-funnel experience

**If Starting Focus = PQL/Product-Led Sales:**
- Prioritize: Experience working with sales teams, data infrastructure
- Look for: Cross-functional leadership, sales collaboration
- Ask about: How they've defined and scored PQLs
- Red flag: Pure product focus without sales collaboration experience

**Matching Template:**
```
Our Focus Area: [Activation / Conversion / Acquisition / PQL]
    ↓
Required Experience:
    - [Specific experience needed]
    - [Specific skills needed]
    ↓
Interview Questions:
    - [Tailored questions for this focus]
    ↓
Case Study/Exercise:
    - [Relevant challenge matching focus area]
```

### Step 4: Conduct Behavioral & Analytical Interviews

**Hila's Favorite Interview Question:**

"What is an experiment you launched that had a very unexpected result? And what did you do after that?"

**Why This Question Works:**

**Signal 1: Volume of Experimentation**
- If they struggle to think of unexpected results, they haven't run many experiments
- Best candidates have multiple examples immediately

**Signal 2: Depth of Thinking**
- Why was it unexpected? Shows how deeply they thought beforehand
- If they should have expected it, they weren't thinking critically enough
- Reveals their understanding of users and psychology

**Signal 3: Learning Ability**
- What did they do afterwards?
- Did they learn something valuable?
- How did they adapt their approach?
- Can they face failure constructively?

**Strong Answer Example:**
"We hypothesized that adding social proof would increase conversions, but it actually decreased them by 15%. It was unexpected because social proof works in most contexts. We dug deeper and realized our users were early adopters who valued being first, not followers. Social proof signaled the product was mainstream, which turned them off. We learned our user psychology was different than typical SaaS buyers. We then ran experiments with exclusivity messaging instead, which increased conversions by 25%."

**Weak Answer Example:**
"We ran an experiment to change button color and it didn't improve conversion. It was unexpected because the growth blog said green buttons convert better. We moved on to other experiments."

**Additional Interview Questions:**

**On Analytical Skills:**
- "Walk me through how you'd calculate if an experiment result is significant"
- "How do you decide what sample size you need for a test?"
- "Tell me about a time you found an insight in data that surprised the team"

**On Prioritization:**
- "You have 10 experiment ideas. How do you decide what to test first?"
- "How do you balance quick wins vs. long-term strategic projects?"

**On Cross-Functional Work:**
- "Tell me about a time you needed to get buy-in from marketing/sales for a product change"
- "How do you handle disagreement with stakeholders on what to prioritize?"

**On Growth Philosophy:**
- "What's the difference between growth and marketing?"
- "When is growth not the right focus for a company?"
- "What are common mistakes you see in PLG implementation?"

### Step 5: Assign Take-Home Exercise

**Exercise Types by Focus Area:**

**For Activation Focus:**
"Here's our current onboarding flow [provide screenshots/description]. Analyze it and propose 3 experiments to improve activation. Include:
- What you'd measure
- Hypothesis for each experiment
- Expected impact
- How you'd sequence them"

**For Conversion Focus:**
"Our free-to-paid conversion is X%. Here's our checkout flow and pricing page. Conduct a heuristic analysis and propose improvements. Include:
- What you'd test first and why
- How you'd measure success
- Potential risks and how to mitigate"

**For Funnel Analysis:**
"Here's our funnel data [provide realistic numbers]. Identify the biggest opportunity and design an experiment to address it. Include:
- Your analysis process
- Why this is the highest leverage area
- Specific experiment design
- Success metrics"

**What to Look For:**
- **Data-driven thinking**: Do they start with data analysis?
- **User empathy**: Do they consider user perspective?
- **Practical experiments**: Are ideas testable and realistic?
- **Clear metrics**: Do they define success clearly?
- **Thoughtful trade-offs**: Do they consider risks and downsides?
- **Communication**: Can they present ideas clearly?

**Red Flags:**
- Purely design-focused changes without data grounding
- No mention of measurement or metrics
- Overly complex solutions
- No consideration of technical feasibility
- Generic best practices without product-specific thinking

### Step 6: Assess Cultural & Team Fit

**Growth-Specific Culture Factors:**

**Comfort with Uncertainty:**
- Growth involves lots of failed experiments
- Look for resilience and learning mindset
- Avoid candidates who need everything to succeed

**Collaboration > Ego:**
- Growth is inherently cross-functional
- Need to influence without authority
- Avoid lone wolves or credit-seekers

**Speed > Perfection:**
- Growth requires rapid experimentation
- Look for bias toward action
- Avoid analysis paralysis types

**Data > Opinions:**
- Decisions should be evidence-based
- Look for intellectual honesty
- Avoid people who defend their ideas despite data

**Questions to Assess Fit:**
- "Tell me about a project that failed. How did you feel?"
- "How do you handle disagreement with data?"
- "Describe your ideal working environment"
- "How do you balance moving fast vs. getting things right?"

### Step 7: Consider Alternative Models

**When to Consider Alternatives to Full-Time Hire:**

**Fractional/Advisor (3-6 months):**
- **When**: Early exploration, building conviction
- **Benefits**: Expertise without full commitment, lower cost
- **Limitations**: Limited bandwidth, less integrated
- **Best for**: Companies pre-Series A, still validating PLG fit

**Interim Growth Lead + Advisor:**
- **When**: Have analytical internal person, need expertise
- **Benefits**: Internal knowledge + external guidance
- **Limitations**: Advisor availability, internal person learning curve
- **Best for**: Budget-constrained companies with strong internal talent

**Agency/Consultancy:**
- **When**: Need execution help, not strategic leadership
- **Benefits**: Can scale up/down, diverse experience
- **Limitations**: Expensive, less product knowledge, less committed
- **Best for**: Specific projects (conversion optimization, paid acquisition) not full motion

**Full-Time Hire:**
- **When**: Committed to PLG, have budget, ready to scale
- **Benefits**: Fully dedicated, builds institutional knowledge, long-term
- **Limitations**: Higher cost, harder to change if wrong fit
- **Best for**: Series A+ with PLG as core strategy

### Step 8: Set Up for Success

**First 30 Days:**
- Complete funnel audit together
- Review all existing data and analytics
- Meet with stakeholders across product, marketing, sales
- Identify 2-3 quick win opportunities
- Establish baseline metrics

**First 90 Days:**
- Launch first experiments
- Secure at least one visible win
- Build relationships with key collaborators
- Establish regular experimentation cadence
- Begin building growth backlog

**Support Structure:**
- Clear executive sponsor (ideally CEO or CPO)
- Dedicated engineering resources (even just one engineer)
- Access to analytics tools and data
- Regular check-ins and feedback
- Protection from distraction and scope creep

**Success Metrics for New Growth Hire:**
- Experiments launched (volume)
- Successful experiments (wins)
- Impact on focus area metric (activation %, conversion %, etc.)
- Stakeholder satisfaction
- Speed of learning and iteration

## Expected Outcomes
- Hired growth leader who matches your specific needs
- Clear role expectations and focus area
- Strong cultural and team fit
- Quick time-to-value (wins in first quarter)
- Foundation for building larger growth team
- Reduced risk of mis-hire through structured process

## Common Pitfalls

### Pitfall 1: Hiring Generic PM for Growth Role
**Problem**: Hiring a great product manager without growth experience and expecting them to figure it out
**Solution**: Prioritize analytical skills and growth mindset over general PM excellence

### Pitfall 2: Mismatched Expertise
**Problem**: Hiring acquisition expert when you need activation help
**Solution**: Be clear on your starting focus and map hire to that need

### Pitfall 3: Expecting Immediate Results
**Problem**: Pressuring new hire for results before they understand product and users
**Solution**: Give 90 days to learn, build relationships, and launch first experiments

### Pitfall 4: Only Looking Externally
**Problem**: Ignoring strong internal candidates who know product and company
**Solution**: Default to internal if you have analytical people interested in growth

### Pitfall 5: No Clear Focus
**Problem**: Hiring growth person but not defining what area they should focus on
**Solution**: Complete funnel audit first, identify starting point, then hire for that

### Pitfall 6: Wrong Interview Focus
**Problem**: Testing for feature PM skills instead of analytical and experimental thinking
**Solution**: Use growth-specific questions like unexpected experiment results

### Pitfall 7: Hiring Senior When Need Execution
**Problem**: Hiring expensive head of growth when you need hands-on PM
**Solution**: Match seniority to your stage and needs (early stage = IC growth PM, later stage = head of growth)

### Pitfall 8: No Support Structure
**Problem**: Hiring growth person but no dedicated engineering or data support
**Solution**: Ensure resources are committed before making hire

### Pitfall 9: Unclear Role Definition
**Problem**: Overlap and confusion with marketing or product teams
**Solution**: Clarify reporting structure, metrics owned, and boundaries
