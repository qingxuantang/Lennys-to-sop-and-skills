# Growth Team Building Framework

## Metadata
- **Source**: Hila Qu - Lenny's Podcast
- **Domain**: Growth & Product-Led Growth
- **Type**: Framework/Process
- **Applicable To**: Founders, Head of Product, VP of Growth, Series A-C companies
- **Difficulty**: Intermediate

## Overview
A structured framework for building and scaling growth teams from initial hire to full growth organization, covering team structures, hiring strategies, and organizational design for product-led growth (PLG) initiatives.

## When to Use
- When you've decided to commit to PLG and need to build a dedicated team
- When your initial growth experiments show promise and you need to scale efforts
- When you need to transition from a tiger team to a permanent growth organization
- When integrating growth functions across product, marketing, and sales

## Prerequisites
- Leadership commitment to PLG for at least 1-2 years
- Foundational data infrastructure (product analytics tool at minimum)
- A free or trial product version available
- Clear conviction on why PLG fits your business model

## Procedure

### Step 1: Choose Your Initial Team Structure

**Option A: Dedicated Growth Squad (Most Common)**
- Hire a head of growth or lead growth PM as the foundation
- This person should have growth PM background and be in the product organization
- Best when initial focus is activation or conversion (confined experimentation areas)

**Option B: Cross-Functional Tiger Team**
- Form temporary team with borrowed resources from product, data, sales, and marketing
- Best when initial focus is product-qualified leads (PQL) or sales-assisted conversion
- Use this approach to validate conviction before full commitment
- Can combine with Option A (growth PM + tiger team for specific initiatives)

**Decision Criteria:**
- If focusing on activation/conversion → Dedicated Squad
- If focusing on PQL/sales integration → Tiger Team or Hybrid
- If unsure about commitment level → Tiger Team to validate

### Step 2: Build the Core Growth Squad

**Priority 1: Growth PM or Head of Growth**
- Skills: Strong analytics, experimentation expertise, data-driven mindset
- Focus: Conversion rates, funnels, journeys (not individual features)
- Can work with borrowed resources initially if needed

**Priority 2: Data Analyst (Critical First Hire)**
- Often should be hired even BEFORE the growth PM
- Essential because "without insight, without foundation, your experimentation is directionless"
- Look for someone who can do instrumentation audits and establish data dictionaries

**Priority 3: Dedicated Engineer(s)**
- Must be dedicated, not borrowed
- Growth requires rapid experimentation and iteration

**Priority 4: Designer**
- Can be shared initially but should support growth experiments
- Needed for activation flows, onboarding, conversion optimization

**Priority 5: User Research Support**
- Can be part-time or borrowed
- Validates assumptions and informs experiment design

### Step 3: Source Your Growth PM

**Internal Hire (Preferred)**
- Current PM who wants to transition to growth
- Analyst who wants to become more product-focused
- Someone analytical from another function (e.g., investor relations) who can socialize resources

**Benefits of Internal:**
- Knows the company, product, and politics
- Can leverage existing relationships
- Faster ramp-up time

**External Hire**
- Use when no internal candidates with interest or capability
- Match expertise to initial focus area:
  - Activation experience if that's your starting point
  - Conversion experience if that's the focus
  - Acquisition experience if that's the priority

### Step 4: Secure Early Wins

**Critical Success Factor:**
- Early wins build momentum and organizational confidence in PLG
- Look for high-leverage opportunities during funnel audit
- Pick starting point based on maximum impact with minimal investment

**Actions:**
- Complete full funnel audit (marketing → signup → activation → conversion)
- Identify 2-3 low-hanging fruit opportunities
- Launch experiments quickly to demonstrate value
- Communicate wins broadly to build support

### Step 5: Evolve to Full PLG Organization

**Think Beyond "Team" to "Org"**
- PLG is cross-functional by nature, not just a product team
- Requires coordination across product, marketing, and sales

**Establish Three Growth Leaders:**

1. **Head of Growth Product** (Center of PLG Org)
   - Reports to product organization
   - Top KPIs: Usage, activation, activated teams, number of PQLs
   - Owns product experience and activation

2. **Head of Growth Marketing** (Counterpart)
   - Reports to marketing organization
   - Top KPIs: High-quality signups, free trial starts meeting quality bar
   - Owns top of funnel acquisition

3. **Head of Product-Led Sales** (Counterpart)
   - Reports to sales organization
   - Top KPIs: PQL conversion rate, efficiency, revenue from PLG motion
   - Owns sales-assisted conversion path

### Step 6: Define Metrics and Accountability

**PLG Metrics Are Different from SLG:**

**Top of Funnel (Growth Marketing):**
- Focus: Quality signups, not just traffic volume
- Metric: Free signups/trials meeting ICP criteria

**Middle of Funnel (Growth Product):**
- Focus: Activation and usage
- Key Metrics:
  - Activated teams/users (hitting aha moment)
  - Number of PQLs generated
  - Time to value

**Bottom of Funnel (Product-Led Sales):**
- Focus: Converting high-value PQLs
- Key Metrics:
  - PQL → Revenue conversion rate
  - Deal efficiency
  - Expansion revenue

### Step 7: Establish Collaboration Structure

**Strong Cross-Functional Collaboration Required:**
- Regular syncs between three growth leaders
- Shared visibility into full funnel metrics
- Coordinated handoffs (Marketing → Product → Sales)
- Unified view of customer journey

**Where Teams Sit:**
- Each leader reports to their respective functional org
- Maintain strong dotted-line relationships
- May consider reporting structure where all three report to CEO or COO at scale

## Expected Outcomes
- Dedicated growth capacity with clear ownership
- Faster iteration and experimentation velocity
- Early wins that build organizational momentum
- Scalable structure that can grow with PLG motion
- Clear metrics and accountability across functions
- Coordinated customer experience from signup to revenue

## Common Pitfalls

### Pitfall 1: Treating One Person as a Magician
**Problem**: Assigning one person to "do PLG" by borrowing resources and coordinating all stakeholders
**Solution**: Provide dedicated team resources and executive support

### Pitfall 2: No Dedicated Engineers
**Problem**: Expecting growth to succeed with borrowed engineering capacity
**Solution**: Dedicate at least one engineer from the start; growth requires rapid experimentation

### Pitfall 3: Skipping the Analyst
**Problem**: Hiring growth PM first without data foundation
**Solution**: Consider hiring analyst first, or find a growth PM who can do analysis initially

### Pitfall 4: Wrong Skill Match
**Problem**: Hiring growth PM with acquisition experience when you need activation expertise
**Solution**: Map growth PM hire to your identified starting point (activation, conversion, etc.)

### Pitfall 5: Stopping at Product Team
**Problem**: Only building growth team in product org without marketing/sales counterparts
**Solution**: Think "PLG org" not "growth team" - establish cross-functional structure

### Pitfall 6: Pressure for Immediate Results
**Problem**: Not giving team time to learn, experiment, and iterate
**Solution**: Commit to 1-2 year roadmap while celebrating early wins

## AI Integration Notes

### Context Signals for This SOP
- User mentions: "building growth team", "hiring for growth", "PLG team structure"
- User is at Series A+ stage with product-market fit
- User has committed budget for new hires
- User mentions they have a free/trial product

### Adaptation Guidance
- **For earlier stage (Seed)**: Start with Option B (Tiger Team) or even just an advisor
- **For later stage (Series B+)**: Move quickly to full org structure (Step 5)
- **For technical products**: Emphasize need for engineer even more
- **For sales-heavy companies**: Start with hybrid approach, emphasize PQL path

### Key Questions to Ask User
1. What's your current stage and team size?
2. What's your initial focus area (activation, conversion, PQL)?
3. Do you have anyone internal who could transition to growth?
4. What's your commitment timeline for PLG?
5. Do you have basic data infrastructure in place?

### Limitations
- Assumes B2B SaaS context; adapt for B2C
- Assumes sufficient funding to hire dedicated team
- Most applicable to companies with $1M-$50M ARR
- Less relevant for pure enterprise sales motion
