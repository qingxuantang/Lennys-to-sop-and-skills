- **Type**: Framework
- **Applicable To**: Founders, Heads of Product, Hiring Managers building growth teams
- **Company Stage**: Post-PMF, ready to scale growth
- **Difficulty**: Intermediate to Advanced

## Overview
A framework for determining when to build a growth team, who to hire first, what to look for in growth hires, and how to structure growth work for maximum impact. Based on building Slack's legendary growth team and hiring world-class growth talent.

## When to Use
- Determining if you're ready to build a dedicated growth team
- Hiring your first growth PM, engineer, or designer
- Structuring growth function within product organization
- Evaluating growth hire candidates
- Deciding between generalist vs. specialist growth roles

## Prerequisites
- Product-market fit with at least one customer segment
- Evidence that users love product after experiencing it
- Retention metrics showing sustained engagement
- Basic analytics instrumentation in place
- Clear understanding of core product value

## Procedure

### Step 1: Determine Readiness for Growth Team
Validate that you're ready to invest in dedicated growth resources.

**✅ Ready for Growth Team When:**

1. **Product-Market Fit Exists**
   - Users love your product after experiencing it
   - Retention cohorts show sustained engagement
   - Users willing to pay for product
   - Even with manual/white-glove onboarding, users see clear value
   - Example: "If I spend 20 minutes explaining my tool, users really get it and use it 6 months later"

2. **Growth Can Accelerate, Not Create PMF**
   - Growth team will "clear away fog of war" to help users find existing value
   - Not trying to growth-hack your way to product-market fit
   - Foundation exists; need to scale what's working
   - Ready to systematically optimize what's already showing promise

3. **You Have Growth Hypotheses**
   - Ideas about what might improve activation/retention
   - Questions about which user segments to focus on
   - Uncertainty about which onboarding approach works best
   - Potential experiments backed up waiting for resources

**❌ NOT Ready for Growth Team When:**
- No clear product-market fit with any segment
- Users don't retain even with white-glove onboarding
- Trying to use growth to "find" PMF
- Core product value proposition unclear
- Retention metrics show fundamental product issues

**Why Timing Matters:**
- Growth team can accelerate and improve PMF, but can't create it
- Optimizing onboarding for product users don't love = more users churning faster
- Need foundation of user value before scaling user acquisition

### Step 2: Choose the Right First Growth Hire
Select growth team member with specific attributes for success.

**Critical Attributes for First Growth Hire:**

1. **High Trust at Company**
   - Respected by existing team members
   - Has credibility with leadership
   - Can influence cross-functional stakeholders
   - Political capital to drive changes

2. **Deep Customer Understanding**
   - Loves and understands your specific customers
   - Can channel customer perspective in decisions
   - Stays connected to user research and feedback
   - Brings customer empathy to growth tactics

3. **Learning Orientation**
   - Curious about what makes users tick
   - Willing to experiment and learn from failures
   - Not dogmatic about "how growth should be done"
   - Understands fundamentals are straightforward (funnels, metrics)

4. **Context-Specific Problem Solving**
   - Knows growth frameworks exist (Reforge, etc.)
   - But focuses on inventing what works for YOUR product
   - Doesn't just apply cookie-cutter approaches
   - Adapts general principles to specific context

**Role Can Be:**
- Product Manager (most common)
- Engineer (for technically-driven growth)
- Product Marketer (for messaging/positioning-driven growth)
- Designer (for experience-driven growth)

**Key Insight:**
"Growth stuff is pretty straightforward—it's a funnel. There's fantastic classes like Reforge, lots of writing online. But everyone is inventing the specific things that work really well for their customer and their product."

### Step 3: Structure Growth as Product Function
Organize growth work to maintain product quality and user focus.

**Report Growth Through Product:**
- Growth typically reports to Head of Product or CPO
- Maintains product quality standards and user empathy
- Avoids pure growth-at-all-costs mentality
- Integrates with broader product strategy

**Early Structure (First Growth Hire):**
- Often called "New User Experience" or similar (not always "Growth")
- Focused on specific area: onboarding, activation, signup flow
- Embedded in product team, not separate silo
- Works closely with core product teams

**Scaling Structure:**
- Can grow into dedicated growth team
- Typically organized by funnel stage: acquisition, activation, retention, monetization
- Maintains close collaboration with core product
- Shares resources (design, eng, data) with product teams

**Anti-Pattern to Avoid:**
- Growth as completely separate from product
- Growth with different quality standards than product
- Growth optimizing metrics without caring about user experience
- "Dark pattern growth" disconnected from product values

### Step 4: Evaluate Growth Candidates Effectively
Assess candidates for growth roles with focus on real work quality.

**Require Work Sample/Project:**

*The Controversial But Effective Approach:*
- Ask candidates to complete 3-hour take-home project
- Let candidates choose from 2-3 problem options
- Evaluate actual thinking and solution quality
- See how they communicate, structure narrative, solve problems

*Why This Works:*
- Reveals how someone actually thinks and works
- Shows quality of solutions they generate
- Demonstrates communication and storytelling ability
- Indicates how they'll perform in the actual role

*Addressing Pushback:*
- Some candidates resist as "free work"
- Merci's perspective: "If you don't want to do 3 hours of free work for a company, you probably don't want to work there"
- Startup reality: Might do lots of work for company that doesn't succeed
- Work sample is mutual evaluation, not exploitation

**What to Evaluate in Work Sample:**

1. **Technical Feasibility**
   - Solutions that could actually be built
   - Understanding of product/platform constraints
   - Not "magic wand" thinking (e.g., assuming complex AI when simple state machine needed)
   - Basic understanding of how tools work

2. **Storytelling Quality**
   - Can they structure a compelling narrative?
   - Is the presentation clear and engaging?
   - Do they explain their reasoning well?
   - At Slack (narrative-driven culture): "Story always won, not the number"

3. **Solution Creativity + Viability**
   - Creative but technically possible solutions
   - Good reasons for choosing specific approach
   - Understanding of tradeoffs
   - Realistic about constraints

4. **Measurement Understanding**
   - Know how to measure success of solution
   - Understand what metrics matter
   - Can design experiment properly
   - Think about learning, not just shipping

5. **Problem Selection**
   - When given choices, which problem do they choose?
   - Learn a lot from every choice candidates make
   - Shows prioritization thinking
   - Reveals what they find interesting/important

**Red Flags:**
- Solutions that ignore technical constraints
- Poor storytelling or unclear communication
- No measurement plan
- Generic approaches without context-specific thinking

**Direct Correlation:**
"People who really kicked ass on this went on to be very successful and lead organizations at Slack"

### Step 5: Hire for Company Fit, Not Just Resume
Focus on two-way fit between candidate and specific company.

**Growth PM Success is Context-Dependent:**
- Successful PM at Lyft ≠ automatically successful at Slack
- Successful PM at Airbnb ≠ automatically successful at Pinterest
- Each company has different culture, processes, success factors
- Resume pedigree matters less than cultural and operational fit

**Hiring as Two-Way Evaluation:**
- Not an "exam you're proctoring"
- Not "sitting in ivory tower in seat of judgment"
- Goal: Ensure offered candidate will accept AND thrive
- Finding someone positioned to succeed at YOUR company

**What to Assess:**

1. **Cultural Fit**
   - Will they thrive in your company culture?
   - Do they match your team's communication style?
   - Example: Slack was narrative-driven; storytelling mattered enormously
   - Company-specific success factors matter more than general "talent"

2. **Intrinsic Motivation**
   - Curiosity about the problem space
   - Genuine interest in your customers
   - Excited about your product category
   - Will be energized by the work, not just the compensation

3. **Collaboration Style**
   - "Anyone who's ever worked with you would immediately work with you again"
   - Strong communicator
   - Builds relationships easily
   - Others enjoy working with them

4. **Long-Term Potential**
   - Can you see them having long, successful career at company?
   - Positioned to grow and take on more responsibility
   - Will accumulate context and become more valuable over time

**Example: Fareed Mosavat**
Merci's hire who became exceptional growth leader:
- Curiosity about how things work
- Great communicator
- Anyone who worked with him would work with him again
- Had long, successful career trajectory at Slack

**Rejection is Normal:**
- Merci was rejected by Airbnb three times
- Probably would not have been as successful there as at Slack
- Company fit matters more than blanket "quality"
- Best candidates find best fit, not just any role

### Step 6: Build Diverse Growth Teams
Proactively build diversity from first growth hires.

**Why Diversity Matters for Growth:**
- Different perspectives lead to better user understanding
- Diverse teams understand diverse user bases
- Creates more inclusive product decisions
- Better problem-solving from varied viewpoints

**Practical Approach:**

1. **Prioritize Early**
   - Diversity is exponentially easier early (first 5-20 people)
   - Becomes harder as team grows and network effects take over
   - Referral networks perpetuate existing team composition
   - Early diversity creates diverse referral networks

2. **Invest in Pipeline**
   - Don't accept "pipeline problem" as excuse
   - Actively seek out diverse candidates
   - Interview many more candidates if needed
   - Source from diverse networks and communities

3. **Understand Conversion Differences**
   - Women may be less risk-seeking on average (unfortunate but real)
   - May see lower conversion rates for risky/early-stage roles
   - Need to interview MORE to achieve diversity (not accept lower rates)
   - Offset conversion differences with volume

4. **Create Flywheel**
   - First two women create "women coworkers" (not just "Merci who plays D&D")
   - Diverse team members refer diverse candidates
   - Baseline for how team treats each other improves
   - Creates self-reinforcing diversity momentum

**Impact on Team Culture:**
- "Huge difference between being only woman and being one of two women"
- "Tone really changes; people are more respectful and kinder"
- "Better for everyone to be in diverse group, not just diverse hires"
- Creates healthier team dynamics overall

## Expected Outcomes
- Growth team that understands and loves your customers
- High-trust individuals who can drive cross-functional change
- Strong storytellers who can build narrative around growth work
- Diverse perspectives improving growth strategy
- Team positioned for long-term success at your company
- Growth work that maintains product quality standards

## Common Pitfalls

**Pitfall 1: Hiring growth before PMF**
- *Symptom*: Trying to hire growth team to "find PMF"
- *Result*: Growth tactics can't compensate for weak product
- *Solution*: Achieve PMF first, then hire growth to scale

**Pitfall 2: Hiring for resume pedigree alone**
- *Symptom*: Hiring "best" candidate on paper without fit assessment
- *Result*: Successful PM from other company struggles at yours
- *Solution*: Assess specific fit for your culture and product

**Pitfall 3: Not requiring work samples**
- *Symptom*: Only doing interviews, no project work
- *Result*: Can't assess actual work quality and thinking
- *Solution*: Require 3-hour project; evaluate real work

**Pitfall 4: Accepting "pipeline problem"**
- *Symptom*: "We'd hire diverse candidates but can't find them"
- *Result*: Homogeneous team that misses diverse user perspectives
- *Solution*: Invest time in sourcing; interview more candidates

**Pitfall 5: Growth separate from product**
- *Symptom*: Growth team reporting outside product org
- *Result*: Growth-at-all-costs mentality, dark patterns
- *Solution*: Keep growth within product org with shared values

**Pitfall 6: Looking for growth "unicorn"**
- *Symptom*: Waiting for perfect candidate with every skill
- *Result*: Never hiring; missing opportunity to build growth
- *Solution*: Hire for trust, customer love, and learning orientation
