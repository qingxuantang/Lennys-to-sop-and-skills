- **Difficulty**: Intermediate

## Overview
The Hierarchy of Engagement is a three-level framework for building enduring consumer social products by focusing on the right metrics at each stage. It addresses the problem of "vanity metrics" (MAUs, downloads, signups) that don't capture whether you're building something people truly value. The framework guides founders to focus on engagement (core actions), retention (making the product better with use), and self-perpetuation (loops that drive growth and re-engagement).

## When to Use
- When building a consumer social product and need clarity on what metrics matter
- When you have "up and to the right" growth charts but unclear if you're building enduring value
- When designing product roadmaps and need to prioritize features
- When optimizing new user experience (NUX) and activation flows
- When evaluating whether your product has the ingredients for long-term retention

## Prerequisites
- A consumer product with actual users (not pre-launch)
- Ability to track user actions and cohort analytics
- Understanding of your product's core value proposition

## Procedure

### Level 1: Define and Optimize the Core Action

**Goal**: Identify the single most important action that indicates a user understands and values your product.

#### Step 1: Identify Your Core Action
The core action is the behavior that:
- Demonstrates the user understands the utility of the product
- Scales to enough users to build a business
- Strongly predicts the user will return

**Analysis approach (Pinterest example)**:
- **Bottom-up**: Analyze every possible action users can take
  - Track what percentage of users complete each action
  - Measure: If users do this action in Week 1, what's their probability of returning Week 2?
  - Rank actions by retention correlation
- **Top-down**: Ask "What is this product fundamentally for?"
  - If a user never does this action, do they really understand the product?
  - Does this action capture the essence of the value proposition?

**Examples of core actions**:
- Facebook (early days): Friending
- Pinterest: Pinning/Repinning to a board
- Evernote: Writing a note
- Snapchat: Sending a snap
- WhatsApp: Sending a message
- YouTube: Subscribing to a creator's channel

#### Step 2: Make Core Action Your North Star Metric
- Define your primary metric around this action (e.g., "Weekly Active Pinners" at Pinterest)
- Use this as the success criteria for all experiments and features
- If an experiment doesn't increase the percentage of users completing the core action, it's not successful

#### Step 3: Optimize New User Experience for Core Action
- Design your entire onboarding (NUX) to get new users to complete the core action
- Remove anything that distracts from this goal
- Don't try to show the full expression of your product immediately
- Common mistake: Adding too many features in NUX, diffusing attention from what matters most

**Test**: Measure NUX success by what percentage of new users complete the core action.

### Level 2: Build Retention Through Accruing Benefits and Mounting Loss

**Goal**: Make the product get better the more someone uses it, and create something they'd lose by leaving.

#### Step 1: Design for Accruing Benefits
Create systems where each core action makes the experience better for that user:

**Pinterest example**:
- Every pin → Better personalized recommendations in home feed
- More pins → More personalized the experience becomes
- The product learns your preferences through use

**Evernote example**:
- Every note → More searchable repository of knowledge
- After thousands of notes, search becomes incredibly valuable
- Product becomes irreplaceable knowledge base

#### Step 2: Create Mounting Loss
Build value that users would lose by abandoning your product:

**Mechanisms**:
- **Personal data repository**: All their saved items, notes, content (Pinterest boards, Evernote notes)
- **Identity creation**: Persistent identity with accruing benefits (Twitter handles, Reddit karma)
- **Audience building**: Subscribers, followers who represent real relationships (YouTube subscriptions)

**Anti-pattern to avoid**: Pure anonymity
- Anonymity prevents accruing benefits and mounting loss
- Users can delete and return with no difference in experience
- Anonymity often enables bad behavior that degrades community
- **Pseudo-anonymity works**: Persistent handles like Twitter/Reddit allow identity building

#### Step 3: Measure Retention with Cohorts
Track weekly cohorts:
1. **Active user retention**: What percentage continues returning?
2. **Core action retention**: What percentage continues completing the core action?
3. **Activity level**: Are users doing more over time?

**Success signal**: "Smile graph" where cohorts plateau or improve over time (vs. constant decay)

**Benchmark**: Don't move to Level 3 until cohorts show a clear plateau.

### Level 3: Create Self-Perpetuating Growth Through Loops

**Goal**: Convert user activity into growth and re-engagement without spending marketing dollars.

#### Step 1: Maximize Network Effects
Every user action should improve the experience for other users:

**Pinterest example**:
- Each pin creates new edge in Pinterest Graph
- Enables better recommendations for all users
- Content quality and diversity improves for everyone

**The energy metaphor**: Think of every user tap/click as kinetic energy → Your job is converting that energy back into better product experience.

#### Step 2: Build Growth Loops
Identify and optimize ways users naturally pull others in:

**Types of growth loops**:
- **User-to-user sharing**: Content sharing that drives signups
- **Collaborative experiences**: Features that require inviting others
- **SEO metadata**: User-generated content creates search traffic
- **Referrals**: Explicit incentives to invite others

**Pinterest example**: "Sarah pinned your pin to her board" notifications → Pulls dormant users back in

#### Step 3: Build Re-engagement Loops
Create triggers that bring users back without marketing spend:

**Examples**:
- Push notifications triggered by other users' actions
- Email digests of relevant activity
- Contextual notifications based on user behavior

**Warning**: Don't overwhelm with notifications
- **Houseparty/Clubhouse failure**: Real-time products that required push notifications
- As users followed more people → notification overload → users started ignoring → flywheel broke down
- Balance frequency and relevance carefully

#### Step 4: Focus on Self-Perpetuation, Not Paid Acquisition
**Why this matters**:
- Consumer products need mass-market scale (hundreds of millions of users)
- Paid acquisition at that scale requires massive capital
- Nearly all successful social products grew organically
- **Exception**: TikTok spent $1B+ on ads, but only after achieving retention with millions of organic users first

**Success signal**: Organic growth accelerates as network effects strengthen.

## Expected Outcomes
- **Level 1**: Clear North Star metric based on core action; focused product roadmap; improved activation rates
- **Level 2**: Cohorts that plateau or improve over time; increasing session frequency; users report they'd be "very disappointed" if product disappeared
- **Level 3**: Significant percentage of growth from organic/viral channels; decreasing CAC; flywheel spinning faster

## Common Pitfalls
1. **Vanity metric obsession**: Tracking MAUs, downloads, or signups instead of engaged users completing core action
2. **Wrong core action**: Choosing an action that doesn't scale or doesn't reflect core value (e.g., YouTube initially thought watching was core action, but subscribing was more important)
3. **Premature feature bloat**: Showing full product complexity before users understand core value
4. **Skipping Level 1 or 2**: Trying to build viral loops before having a retentive product
5. **Pure anonymity**: Preventing identity persistence that enables accruing benefits
6. **Notification overload**: Breaking the engagement loop through excessive push notifications
7. **Geographic diffusion**: Growing user base across many geographies without focus (weakens network density)

## AI Integration Notes
When applying this framework:
- Context signals: User mentions "vanity metrics," growth plateau despite user numbers, struggling with retention, unclear product priorities
- Framework applies primarily to consumer social products, but Level 1 and 2 concepts extend to any consumer product
- Level 3 is most critical for products requiring mass-market scale to succeed
- For products without social/network elements (like Evernote), Levels 1-2 still apply but Level 3 is unattainable
- When retention is the issue, dig into Level 2 mechanisms
- When acquisition costs are too high, examine Level 3 loops
- Adapt the framework based on product stage: pre-PMF focus on Level 1, post-PMF optimize Levels 2-3
