- **Applicable To**: Product Managers, Team Leads, Anyone running important meetings
- **Difficulty**: Beginner to Intermediate

## Overview
The High-Impact Meeting Management System treats meetings as high-value, high-cost time investments that demand rigorous preparation, clear facilitation, and disciplined follow-through. This system uses pre-reads, real-time visual editing, structured decision frameworks (like traffic light matrices), and comprehensive notes to ensure every meeting drives clarity and action.

## When to Use
- When running decision-making meetings
- When coordinating cross-functional teams
- When meetings frequently end without clear decisions or next steps
- When people join meetings unprepared
- When post-meeting confusion arises ("Wait, what did we decide?")
- When you want to ensure people not in the meeting can stay informed
- When running recurring strategic or operational reviews

## Prerequisites
- Ability to create and share documentation (Google Slides, Docs, Notion, etc.)
- Calendar system that supports attachments and meeting descriptions
- Team commitment to reading pre-reads and attending prepared
- Collaborative editing tools for real-time updates during meetings

## Procedure

### Step 1: Prepare 24 Hours Before (Pre-Meeting)
Set the meeting up for success with thorough preparation.

**Send the Agenda and Pre-Read**:
- **Timing**: Must be sent at least 24 hours before the meeting
  - Some leaders will cancel meetings if the 24-hour rule is violated
  - This communicates respect for attendees' time and preparation

- **Method**: Attach to or include in the calendar invite
  - Use the calendar invite as the canonical communication thread
  - Don't create separate email threads—keep everything in one place
  - Click "reply all" on the calendar invite to send the pre-read

- **Pre-Read Contents** (typically a Google Slides deck):
  1. **Meeting Purpose**: What are we here to accomplish?
  2. **Agenda**: Numbered list (never bullets) of topics to discuss
  3. **Context**: Background information attendees need
  4. **Decision Framework**: If it's a decision meeting (see Step 2)
  5. **Discussion Questions**: Specific questions to consider
  6. **Supporting Data**: Relevant metrics, research, user feedback

**Enable Pre-Meeting Discussion**:
- Use commenting features in Google Slides/Docs
- Attendees can ask questions and provide input before the meeting
- This often resolves issues before the meeting even starts
- PM can update the pre-read based on early feedback

**Set Expectations**:
- Attendees are expected to read the pre-read before joining
- Come prepared with questions and perspectives
- If you haven't read the pre-read, you can't meaningfully participate

### Step 2: Structure Decision Meetings with Three Options
Use a proven framework to facilitate effective decision-making.

**The Three Options + Recommendation Format**:

Every decision meeting should present:
1. **Three distinct options** (minimum)
   - If there are only two, create a third to expand thinking
   - If there are more than four, group or prioritize to three main choices

2. **A clear recommendation** from the PM or decision owner
   - Which option do you recommend and why?
   - What's your confidence level?
   - What would change your mind?

**Use Traffic Light Matrices** (Not Pros/Cons Lists):

Traditional pros/cons format:
```
Option A
Pros:
- Fast to implement
- Low cost
Cons:
- Poor user experience
- Legal concerns
```
❌ **Problem**: Flat list of text, hard to compare visually, no context on severity

**Traffic Light Matrix Format**:

| **Option** | **Engineering Feasibility** | **User Experience** | **Legal Risk** | **Business Impact** |
|------------|----------------------------|---------------------|----------------|---------------------|
| Option A   | 🟢 Easy (2 weeks)          | 🔴 Poor UX          | 🔴 High risk   | 🟡 Moderate         |
| Option B   | 🟡 Moderate (1 month)      | 🟢 Great UX         | 🟢 Low risk    | 🟢 High impact      |
| Option C   | 🔴 Hard (3 months)         | 🟢 Great UX         | 🟢 Low risk    | 🟢 Very high        |

✅ **Benefits**:
- **Visual clarity**: Quickly see which options have the most red vs. green
- **Functional input**: Each column can be owned by a different function
  - Engineering owns feasibility column
  - Design owns UX column
  - Legal owns risk column
  - Product owns business impact column
- **Structured collaboration**: People can "plug into" the framework
  - Each function fills out their cells with rationale
  - Everyone contributes their expertise
- **Clear comparison**: Easy to spot trade-offs and patterns

**Define Evaluation Criteria** (The Columns):

Two approaches for columns:

1. **By Function**: Legal perspective, policy perspective, product perspective, engineering perspective
2. **By Priority**: User experience, engineering feasibility, business impact, time to ship, internal complexity

Choose criteria based on what matters most for this decision.

**How to Use Traffic Lights**:
- 🟢 **Green**: Positive, low-risk, strong on this dimension
- 🟡 **Yellow**: Moderate, acceptable, some concerns
- 🔴 **Red**: Negative, high-risk, problematic on this dimension

Include specific rationale in each cell explaining the color.

### Step 3: Facilitate the Meeting with Visual Anchors
Run the meeting to maximize clarity and decision quality.

**Use a Visual for Everything**:
- Project the pre-read (Google Slides) on screen
- Everyone should be looking at the same thing
- If someone joins late, they can see exactly where you are in the agenda
- Never have meetings that are just talking—always have a visual anchor

**Navigate Using Numbered Agenda Items**:
- "We're on item 3 now: evaluating the three options"
- "Let's move to item 4: discussing implementation timeline"
- Anyone can reference specific items clearly

**Real-Time Edit Decisions**:
This is the critical practice that creates extreme clarity.

1. **When a decision is made**, immediately edit the slide
   - Add a ⭐ star or highlight to the chosen option
   - Or change the font color, add a checkmark, etc.
   - Make it visually obvious what was decided

2. **Document next steps in real-time**:
   ```
   ✅ DECISION: We're going with Option B

   NEXT STEPS:
   1. [Owner Name] - Draft technical spec by [date]
   2. [Owner Name] - Get legal approval by [date]
   3. [Owner Name] - Schedule follow-up review for [date]
   ```

3. **Invite corrections immediately**:
   - "Does this capture what we decided?"
   - "Did I miss any next steps?"
   - If someone says "That's not what I heard," resolve it NOW
   - Don't end the meeting until everyone agrees on what's written

**Benefits of Real-Time Editing**:
- No post-meeting confusion about decisions
- Everyone leaves aligned
- Clear accountability for next steps
- Creates a record for people not in the meeting

**Manage the Flow**:
- Keep discussion focused on current agenda item
- Capture off-topic items in a "parking lot" slide
- Timebox discussions if they're running long
- Drive toward decisions, not endless discussion

### Step 4: Follow Up Within 24 Hours (Post-Meeting)
Close the loop to ensure decisions stick and people stay informed.

**Send Meeting Notes** (Within 24 hours):
- **Method**: Reply all to the calendar invite
  - This keeps the entire thread in one place
  - Pre-read → Meeting → Notes all on the same thread
  - Easy to find later

- **Contents of Notes**:
  1. **Attendees**: Who was there
  2. **Decisions Made**: What was decided (copy from the edited slides)
  3. **Next Steps**: Who's doing what by when (copy from slides)
  4. **Open Questions**: Anything unresolved
  5. **Updated Slides**: Attach the edited version of the pre-read

**Value for Non-Attendees**:
- Anyone not in the meeting can get up to speed quickly
- They see the full context (pre-read) and outcome (notes)
- Reduces need for 1:1 catch-ups
- Creates institutional memory

**Update Canonical Documentation**:
- If the decision affects the project's canonical doc, update it
- Link the meeting notes to the canonical doc
- Ensure the single source of truth reflects new decisions

**Track Action Items**:
- Add next steps to task tracking system (Asana, Jira, etc.)
- Tag owners so they have accountability
- Set reminders for follow-up

### Step 5: Establish Meeting Cadences and Types
Different meeting types serve different purposes.

**Strategic Meetings** (Weekly or Bi-Weekly):
- **Purpose**: Open-ended strategic discussion
- **Format**: Longer (60-90 minutes), less structured
- **Content**: Big picture thinking, problem-solving, ideation
- **Preparation**: Pre-reads with strategic questions or frameworks
- **Outcome**: Alignment on direction, identification of key issues

**Operational Meetings** (Weekly):
- **Purpose**: Tactical execution, status updates
- **Format**: Highly structured, shorter (30-60 minutes)
- **Content**: Work stream owners report weekly progress
- **Preparation**: Pre-read with status for each work stream
- **Outcome**: Identify blockers, ensure teams are coordinated

**Decision Meetings** (As Needed):
- **Purpose**: Make a specific decision
- **Format**: Structured around the decision framework
- **Content**: Three options + recommendation, traffic light matrix
- **Preparation**: Comprehensive pre-read with all necessary context
- **Outcome**: Clear decision and next steps

**Review Meetings** (Monthly/Quarterly):
- **Purpose**: Assess progress toward goals
- **Format**: Metrics review, retrospective
- **Content**: Data dashboards, wins/learnings, course corrections
- **Preparation**: Pre-read with key metrics and analysis
- **Outcome**: Refined strategy or priorities

**Don't Mix Meeting Types**:
- Strategic meetings that turn operational waste time
- Operational meetings that turn strategic lose focus
- Be clear upfront what type of meeting it is

### Step 6: Cancel Meetings That Don't Meet the Bar
Respect everyone's time by only holding high-value meetings.

**Cancel If**:
- Pre-read wasn't sent 24 hours in advance
- Not enough people have read the pre-read
- The decision can be made asynchronously
- The necessary stakeholders can't attend

**Alternative Approaches**:
- **Async decision-making**: Use comments on docs instead of meetings
- **Pairwise when appropriate**: Sometimes a 1:1 is more efficient than a group meeting
  - But generally avoid pairwise for cross-functional decisions (see Canonical Everything SOP)
- **Shorter meetings**: Not every meeting needs to be 60 minutes

**Meeting Hygiene**:
- Start on time (rewards people who show up prepared)
- End on time (respect calendars)
- No phones/laptops unless needed for the meeting
- One conversation at a time

## Expected Outcomes
- **Fewer wasted meetings**: Only high-value meetings happen
- **Better decisions**: Structured frameworks lead to thoughtful choices
- **Clear accountability**: Everyone knows who's doing what
- **Reduced confusion**: Real-time editing eliminates "what did we decide?" questions
- **Inclusive communication**: People not in the meeting stay informed
- **Faster execution**: Clear decisions lead to faster action
- **Institutional knowledge**: Meeting notes create a record of decisions and context

## Common Pitfalls
- **Skipping the pre-read**: Trying to present all context in the meeting
  - *How to avoid*: Make 24-hour pre-reads non-negotiable
  - Cancel meetings that violate this rule

- **Not editing in real-time**: Saving documentation for after the meeting
  - *How to avoid*: Practice live editing during meetings
  - Assign someone to do the editing if the facilitator can't

- **Using bullets instead of numbers**: Making agenda items hard to reference
  - *How to avoid*: Always use numbered lists (1, 2, 3, not •)
  - This seems trivial but compounds across many meetings

- **Pros/cons instead of traffic lights**: Using flat lists instead of visual matrices
  - *How to avoid*: Create traffic light templates for decision meetings
  - Train team on how to fill them out

- **Letting meetings run without decisions**: Discussion without conclusion
  - *How to avoid*: Timebox discussions, drive toward decisions
  - End meetings with clear next steps or schedule follow-up decision meeting

- **Not sending notes**: Assuming everyone remembers what was decided
  - *How to avoid*: Send notes within 24 hours as a standard practice
  - Make this non-negotiable

- **Multiple competing threads**: Creating separate emails instead of using calendar invite
  - *How to avoid*: Always reply-all to the calendar invite
  - Train team to look for meeting info on the invite

- **Over-indexing on process**: Creating bureaucracy that slows things down
  - *How to avoid*: Ensure process saves time, not adds time
  - Get feedback from team on whether meetings feel efficient

- Product Manager as Conductor Framework (sops/growth/pm-as-conductor-framework-001.md)
- SPADE Decision Framework (sops/decision-making/spade-decision-framework-001.md)

## AI Integration Notes
This SOP should be triggered when:
- User asks "How do I run better meetings?"
- User mentions "meetings that waste time" or "unclear decisions"
- User asks about "decision-making frameworks" or "facilitating discussions"
- User describes post-meeting confusion or lack of follow-through
- User asks "How do I get people to prepare for meetings?"

Adapt this framework by:
- Company culture (some companies are more/less formal)
- Meeting size (very small teams may not need as much structure)
- Remote vs. in-person (remote may need even more rigor)
- Decision importance (strategic decisions need more structure than tactical ones)

Key principles to emphasize:
- "Meetings are high-value and high-cost—treat them accordingly"
- "24-hour pre-reads are non-negotiable"
- "Real-time editing creates extreme clarity"
- "Use the calendar invite as the canonical thread"
- "Traffic lights beat pros/cons for comparing options"

Edge cases:
- Brainstorming meetings may need less structure (but still need preparation)
- Crisis meetings may not allow 24 hours for pre-reads (adjust accordingly)
- Very senior executive meetings may have different norms (adapt respectfully)
- Cultural differences in communication styles (some cultures prefer more indirectness)

Tools and Templates:
- Google Slides for pre-reads and real-time editing
- Calendar invites (Gmail, Outlook, etc.) for canonical thread
- Traffic light decision matrix template (create reusable template)
- Meeting notes template with standard sections
