# Kindle vs Fire Growth Strategy Framework

## Metadata
- **Source**: Casey Winters - Lenny's Podcast
- **Domain**: Growth / Strategy
- **Type**: Framework SOP
- **Applicable To**: Founders, Growth Leaders, Product Managers
- **Company Stage**: Pre-PMF to Growth (0 to 1.0)
- **Difficulty**: Intermediate

## Overview
Growth strategies fall into two distinct phases: **Kindle strategies** (non-scalable hacks to get early users) and **Fire strategies** (scalable loops that drive millions of users). The key insight: **the goal of your kindle strategies is only to unlock the fire strategies** — they exist to prove and ignite the scalable growth loops.

## When to Use
- Pre-product-market fit stage
- Planning early growth tactics
- Deciding when to hire growth people
- Sequencing growth investments
- Evaluating if you're ready to scale

## Prerequisites
- Product that delivers value
- Understanding of target users
- Some initial traction or interest
- Hypothesis about scalable growth

## Core Concept: Two Phases of Growth

### Kindle Strategies (Phase 1)
**Definition**: Non-scalable hacks to acquire your first users.

**Characteristics:**
- Don't scale (that's okay)
- Founder-driven
- High touch, high effort per user
- Goal is learning and unlocking

**Purpose:**
- Get early users to validate product
- Learn what resonates
- Identify potential fire strategies
- Build foundation for scale

**Examples:**
- Direct outreach to potential users
- Attending events and conferences
- Personal network activation
- Manual matching/curation
- Handholding early customers

### Fire Strategies (Phase 2)
**Definition**: Scalable growth loops that can take you to millions of users.

**Characteristics:**
- Scale exponentially or linearly
- Can be systematized
- Compound over time
- Require investment to optimize

**Types of Fire Strategies:**
| Strategy | How It Works | Example |
|----------|--------------|---------|
| Viral/Referral Loops | Users invite users | Dropbox referral |
| Content Loops | Content attracts users who create content | Pinterest, Reddit |
| Sales Loops | Revenue funds more salespeople | Enterprise SaaS |
| Paid Acquisition | Revenue funds profitable ads | DTC brands |
| SEO/Organic | Content ranks and attracts users | Airbnb, Eventbrite |

## Procedure

### Step 1: Identify Your Hypothesized Fire Strategy
Before kindling, know what you're trying to ignite.

**Questions to ask:**
- How could this product grow at scale?
- What do similar successful products use?
- What's natural to our product's value?

**Match product to likely fire strategy:**
| Product Type | Likely Fire Strategy |
|--------------|---------------------|
| Social/community | Viral loops, content loops |
| B2B SaaS (SMB) | Content, product-led + sales |
| B2B SaaS (Enterprise) | Sales loops |
| Marketplace | SEO, content, referral |
| Consumer app | Viral, paid, content |

### Step 2: Design Kindle Strategies to Test Fire Hypothesis
Your kindle efforts should prove the fire can work.

**If hypothesized fire is viral:**
- Kindle: Get early users and watch if they naturally share
- Signal: Do users tell others unprompted?
- Learn: What triggers sharing?

**If hypothesized fire is content/SEO:**
- Kindle: Manually create content, seed initial community
- Signal: Does content rank? Does UGC happen?
- Learn: What content resonates?

**If hypothesized fire is sales:**
- Kindle: Founder-led sales
- Signal: Can you close deals? What objections arise?
- Learn: What's the sales motion?

**If hypothesized fire is paid:**
- Kindle: Small paid tests
- Signal: Can you acquire profitably?
- Learn: What channels, creative, audiences work?

### Step 3: Execute Kindle Strategies
Do the non-scalable work.

**Founder responsibilities:**
- You do the kindling (don't delegate yet)
- Be in direct contact with early users
- Learn everything possible
- Look for signals of fire potential

**Common kindle tactics:**
- Cold outreach (email, LinkedIn, Twitter)
- Warm intros through network
- Attending industry events
- Joining communities where users are
- Creating initial content manually
- Offering concierge service

**Success metric for kindle:**
- Not scale (kindle doesn't scale)
- Learning and unlocking
- Proving the fire strategy can work

### Step 4: Recognize When Fire is Unlocked
Know when you've kindled successfully.

**Signals that fire strategy is ready:**
- Clear pattern in what drives growth
- Repeatability demonstrated
- Unit economics work (or nearly work)
- You can describe the loop clearly

**Example signals:**
| Fire Strategy | Unlock Signal |
|---------------|---------------|
| Viral | K-factor > 0.5, natural sharing observed |
| Content/SEO | Content ranks, UGC emerging |
| Sales | Repeatable close rate, clear ICP |
| Paid | Positive or near-positive CAC:LTV |

### Step 5: Hire to Harness the Fire
Once unlocked, bring in specialists.

**Hiring by fire strategy:**
| Fire Strategy | First Hire |
|---------------|------------|
| Viral/Product-led | Growth PM |
| Content/SEO | Content marketer, SEO specialist |
| Sales | First salesperson (then hire more) |
| Paid | Performance marketer |

**Timing:**
- Don't hire before fire is unlocked
- Hire once you have signal
- Their job is to 10X what you proved works

### Step 6: Sequence to Additional Fires
One fire can kindle another.

**Common sequences:**
- Viral → Paid (retargeting engaged users)
- Sales → Content (sales learns what content needed)
- SEO → Paid (brand awareness enables paid)
- Product-led → Sales (product qualifies leads)

**Build sequentially:**
- Master one fire before adding another
- Each fire should be working before moving on
- Some fires naturally lead to others

## Expected Outcomes
- Efficient use of early-stage resources
- Clear signal before scaling investment
- Right hires at right time
- Scalable growth when ready
- Avoided premature scaling

## Common Pitfalls

### Trying to scale kindle strategies
- "We need more people doing outreach"
- Kindle doesn't scale — that's the point
- Focus on unlocking fire, not scaling kindle

### Skipping kindle to go straight to fire
- Throwing money at paid without signal
- Hiring sales team before founder sells
- Building viral features without users
- Fire needs kindle to ignite

### Confusing kindle success with fire success
- "We got 100 users from events!"
- Kindle success ≠ scalable growth
- Did it prove the fire strategy works?

### Not knowing what fire you're kindling toward
- Random early tactics
- No hypothesis about scale
- Kindle should be intentional

### Hiring growth people too early
- Before fire is unlocked
- They can't kindle effectively
- Wait until you have signal

- Product-Market Fit Assessment

## AI Integration Notes

### Context signals that should trigger this SOP:
- Early stage growth questions
- "How do we get our first users?"
- "When should we hire growth?"
- "Should we scale this tactic?"

### How to apply:
- Identify if user is in kindle or fire phase
- Help hypothesize likely fire strategies
- Design kindle tactics that test fire
- Recognize unlock signals

### Key insight:
Kindle strategies only exist to unlock fire strategies. Don't try to scale the kindle — use it to prove and ignite the fire that will actually drive growth.
