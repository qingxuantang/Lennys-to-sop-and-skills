# Market Currents and Investment Thesis Framework

## Metadata
- **Source**: Sarah Tavel - Lenny's Podcast
- **Domain**: Strategy / Investment
- **Type**: Framework
- **Applicable To**: Founders selecting markets, investors evaluating opportunities, product leaders choosing expansion vectors
- **Difficulty**: Intermediate

## Overview
Markets should be evaluated not by size alone, but by the "currents" or momentum that will pull a company forward. This framework helps identify markets with strong dynamics of change that make building easier, as opposed to static markets that require massive effort. It challenges the conventional wisdom of TAM (Total Addressable Market) analysis and emphasizes underestimated markets with adjacent expansion potential, earned secrets, and favorable timing.

## When to Use
- When evaluating which market to enter with a new product
- When investors pressure you to pursue larger TAM
- When deciding between a small focused market vs. broad market approach
- When assessing whether timing is right for an opportunity
- When competitors dismiss your market as "too small"

## Prerequisites
- Understanding of the problem space you want to solve
- Ability to research market dynamics and trends
- Willingness to start small despite large ambitions
- Capital constraints that require strategic focus

## Procedure

### Step 1: Reframe How You Think About Markets

#### Conventional View (Often Wrong)
Markets as "bodies of water":
- Static pools of opportunity
- Measured primarily by size (TAM)
- Bigger is always better
- Success requires warming entire ocean

**Problems with this view**:
- Ignores dynamics of change
- Overweights market size, underweights market conditions
- Leads to competing in crowded spaces
- Requires massive resources to make progress

#### Better View: Markets as Currents

**Sarah Tavel's metaphor**:
"Markets have currents where you can put a plank of wood on the river and it will pull you forward, versus a market that doesn't have momentum where you need to build something really big and fancy to make any progress."

**What to look for**:
- **Dynamics of change**: What's shifting in the market?
- **Momentum**: What forces are creating forward motion?
- **Ease of building**: Will current help or hinder?
- **Why now**: What makes this moment special?

**Key insight**: Care less about market size, more about market momentum.

### Step 2: Identify the Current (Dynamics of Change)

#### Ask "Why Now?"

What has changed or is changing that creates opportunity?

**Types of currents**:

**Technology shifts**:
- New capabilities enabling previously impossible solutions
- Example: Mobile + GPS enabled ridesharing
- Example: LLMs potentially enabling automation of long-tail supplier onboarding

**Behavioral changes**:
- New consumer behaviors or expectations
- Example: Remote work normalizing → opportunity for collaboration tools
- Example: Creator economy → platforms for creator monetization

**Regulatory changes**:
- New rules creating or removing friction
- Example: Crypto regulations → stablecoin opportunities
- Example: Data privacy laws → new compliance solutions

**Economic shifts**:
- Macroeconomic changes creating demand
- Example: High inflation + weak local currencies → demand for USD stablecoins
- Example: Rising interest rates → changes in DeFi viability

**Generational changes**:
- New generation with different preferences/values
- Example: Gen Z preferring video → TikTok opportunity
- Example: Values around sustainability → marketplace for secondhand goods

**Competitive vacuum**:
- Incumbents failing to serve segment
- Example: DoorDash targeting suburbs ignored by others
- Example: Hipcamp serving hardcore campers overlooked by booking sites

#### Sarah Tavel's Current Examples

**Strong current: USD Stablecoins**
- Inflation in many countries
- Weak local currencies
- Real demand for stable store of value
- Multiple shapes/forms possible
- Strong momentum pulling opportunities forward

**Weak current: DeFi (in 2024)**
- High treasury yields reduce DeFi arbitrage opportunity
- Market conditions work against the model
- Swimming upstream, not riding a current

**Lesson**: Same broad category (crypto), radically different currents

### Step 3: Seek Underestimated Markets

#### Why Small Markets Can Be Better

**Benchmark's contrarian view**:
"We get excited about markets that might seem small from the outside."

**Advantages of underestimated markets**:

1. **No competition initially**
- Others think market too small to pursue
- Gives time to build without pressure
- More elements favoring market tipping

2. **Easier to tip markets**
- Smaller total market = reach saturation faster
- Prove playbook more efficiently
- Lower capital requirements to dominate

3. **Adjacent expansion potential**
- Small market can grow into larger adjacent markets
- But only if there are adjacencies (not a "cul-de-sac")

4. **Founder focus**
- Smaller market = laser beam ambition vs. diffuse sun
- Can make core users extremely happy
- Build defensible position before expanding

**Sarah Tavel quote**:
"If other people are telling you the market's too small, we would love to get to know you."

#### Examples of Underestimated Markets

**Airbnb**:
- Initial: Air mattresses during conferences (tiny market)
- Seen as: How big could this really get?
- Reality: Disrupted entire hospitality industry
- Key: Adjacent expansion into all lodging

**Etsy**:
- Initial: Handmade craft fair goods online
- Seen as: Niche hobby market
- Reality: Underestimated for years, became massive
- Key: Passionate seller base, unique supply

**Hipcamp**:
- Initial: Hardcore campers with tents on private land
- Seen as: Small outdoors enthusiast niche
- Reality: Hosts invested in infrastructure (showers, fire pits, treehouses, yurts)
- Key: Success expanded to glampers and broader market
- Adjacent: Grew from camping → outdoor experiences

### Step 4: Find the "Earned Secret"

#### Definition
An earned secret is an insight about a market opportunity that:
- Others are overlooking
- You discovered through direct experience/research
- Creates obvious opportunity once you see it
- Makes you think "How does it still work this way?"

**Characteristics of earned secrets**:
- Not obvious from desk research
- Gained through proximity to problem
- Creates "unfair" insight advantage
- Often hidden in plain sight

#### How to Discover Earned Secrets

**Immerse in the domain**:
- Work in the industry
- Be a power user of existing solutions
- Talk extensively to potential customers
- Identify pain points others miss

**Look for inefficiencies**:
- Manual processes that should be automated
- Fragmented experiences that should be unified
- Expensive middlemen adding little value
- Underserved customer segments

**Study what's changing**:
- What used to be impossible but now is feasible?
- What are people doing as workarounds?
- Where are substitutes clearly inadequate?

**Example patterns**:
- "Everyone uses spreadsheets and email for this"
- "There's a massive Facebook group coordinating this manually"
- "People pay 10x more than necessary because there's no alternative"
- "This only works if you live in major cities"

### Step 5: Assess Adjacent Expansion Potential

#### Critical Test: Cul-de-sac vs. Highway

**Cul-de-sac market** (avoid):
- Small market with no natural expansion paths
- Success doesn't unlock new opportunities
- Dead end for growth

**Highway market** (pursue):
- Small starting point
- Clear adjacent markets to expand into
- Initial success enables next step
- Compounding opportunities

#### Mapping Adjacencies

**Geographic adjacencies**:
- City A → City B → Region → Country
- Example: DoorDash suburbs → urban areas → international

**Category adjacencies**:
- Core category → Related categories → Broader platform
- Example: Uber black cars → UberX → UberPool → UberEats → Uber Freight

**Customer segment adjacencies**:
- Early adopter segment → Mainstream segments
- Example: Hipcamp hardcore campers → glampers → outdoor experience seekers

**Use case adjacencies**:
- Initial use case → Related use cases → Platform
- Example: Airbnb conference lodging → vacation rentals → experiences → long-term housing

**Questions to ask**:
1. If we succeed in Market A, what adjacent Market B becomes accessible?
2. Does success in core market create assets (brand, network, data) useful in adjacencies?
3. Are there 3+ clear expansion vectors?
4. Is total expansion potential large enough to justify venture scale?

#### Warning: Etsy Case Study

**What happened**:
- Started: Handmade goods (authentic, focused)
- Pre-IPO: Chased GMV growth
- Result: Mass-produced goods flooded platform
- Outcome: Eroded trust with handmade sellers and buyers
- Cost: CEO change, major pivot needed

**Lesson**: Expand to adjacencies, but stay true to what makes you special. Don't chase growth that undermines your core.

### Step 6: Evaluate Timing and Current Strength

#### Timing Assessment Questions

**Is this a strong current right now?**
- Are forces aligned to pull opportunity forward?
- Or swimming upstream against opposing forces?

**Will current strengthen or weaken?**
- Are dynamics accelerating or decelerating?
- Example: Pandemic → remote work tools (strengthening)
- Example: Rising rates → DeFi (weakening)

**How long is the window?**
- Is this a brief moment or lasting shift?
- Do you need to move extremely fast or can be methodical?

**Am I early, on-time, or late?**
- Early: Might be too soon, but less competition
- On-time: Sweet spot of readiness + opportunity
- Late: Might face entrenched competition, saturated market

#### Red Flags (Weak/Opposing Current)

- ⚠️ Macro trends working against opportunity
- ⚠️ Consumer behavior moving opposite direction
- ⚠️ Technology not yet ready for vision
- ⚠️ Regulatory environment hostile
- ⚠️ Incumbents aggressively defending
- ⚠️ Multiple well-funded competitors already established

### Step 7: Combine Underestimation + Current + Secret + Adjacencies

#### Ideal Market Profile

**The complete picture**:
1. ✅ Market appears small to others (underestimated)
2. ✅ Strong current pulling opportunity forward (why now)
3. ✅ Earned secret giving you unique insight
4. ✅ Clear adjacent expansion opportunities (not cul-de-sac)
5. ✅ Favorable conditions for tipping (fragmented supply, weak competition)
6. ✅ Founder focus advantage over broader competitors

**When you have all six**: High conviction opportunity

**When missing several**: Reconsider or wait for conditions to improve

## Expected Outcomes
- Market selection that maximizes probability of success
- Clarity on "why now" and market timing
- Confidence despite others calling market "too small"
- Roadmap showing how small market expands to venture scale
- Founder focus on beachhead while seeing broader vision

## Common Pitfalls
1. **Chasing large TAMs with weak currents**: Big static market vs. small dynamic market
2. **Ignoring timing**: Right market, wrong time (DeFi in high-rate environment)
3. **Cul-de-sac markets**: Small market with no expansion path
4. **Swimming upstream**: Fighting opposing macro forces
5. **No earned secret**: Obvious market with no unique insight
6. **Confusing size with strength**: $10B market with no momentum < $100M market with strong current
7. **Premature expansion**: Leaving beachhead before establishing dominance (Etsy losing its way)

## AI Integration Notes
When applying this framework:
- Context signals: Founder questioning market size, pushback on TAM, market selection decisions, expansion timing
- Challenge conventional TAM thinking—reframe to current strength
- Help identify specific dynamics creating momentum
- When market seems too small, assess adjacent expansion potential
- Timing assessment critical—same opportunity different in different macro conditions
- Strong current + underestimated market = ideal Benchmark investment
- Cul-de-sac test essential—small markets need expansion paths
- Earned secrets indicate founder has unique advantage
- Not all adjacencies are equal—prioritize natural extensions over forced pivots
- Use examples: Airbnb, Etsy, Hipcamp (underestimated → massive), DeFi vs. stablecoins (current strength matters)
