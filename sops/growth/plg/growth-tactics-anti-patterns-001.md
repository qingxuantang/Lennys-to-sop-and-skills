## Metadata
- **Source**: Elena Verna - Lenny's Podcast (Episode 3.0)
- **Domain**: Growth
- **Type**: Checklist SOP
- **Applicable To**: Growth Leaders, Founders, Product Managers
- **Company Stage**: All stages
- **Difficulty**: Beginner

## Overview
This SOP catalogs growth tactics that consistently fail to produce results. Before investing in any growth initiative, check this list to avoid common traps that waste resources and delay real growth.

## When to Use
- Planning growth roadmap or initiatives
- Evaluating proposed growth tactics
- New growth leader joining company
- Quarterly growth strategy review
- When growth has stalled and you're considering new approaches

## Prerequisites
- Existing product with some traction
- Growth team or growth-focused resources
- Clear understanding of current growth metrics

## Anti-Pattern Checklist

### Anti-Pattern 1: Hiring a Growth Team Before PMF

**The mistake**: Thinking you need a growth team to figure out product-market fit and distribution.

**Why it fails**:
- Growth teams optimize existing traction, not create it
- PMF discovery cannot be outsourced
- Growth team will churn if there's nothing to grow

**What to do instead**:
- Founders must own PMF and initial distribution
- Only hire growth after organic traction exists
- Growth team amplifies what's working, doesn't find PMF

---

### Anti-Pattern 2: Marketing Site Redesigns for Performance

**The mistake**: Believing a rebrand or website redesign will improve acquisition metrics.

**Why it fails**:
- New CMOs often treat site as personal taste expression
- Redesigns almost never produce measurable performance gains
- Often makes things worse by disrupting what was working

**What to do instead**:
- Iterate on existing design with A/B tests
- Focus on messaging and positioning first
- Only redesign for specific, measurable goals

---

### Anti-Pattern 3: Over-Experimenting Everything

**The mistake**: Making every single growth initiative an experiment.

**Why it fails**:
- Creates analysis paralysis
- Some things should just ship based on best practices
- Experimentation infrastructure is expensive
- Teams spend more time measuring than executing

**What to do instead**:
- Reserve experiments for high-uncertainty decisions
- Ship obvious improvements without testing
- Build conviction through qualitative insights first
- Experiment on genuinely unknown outcomes

---

### Anti-Pattern 4: Launching Features Without Distribution Plan

**The mistake**: Building features and hoping they'll drive growth on their own.

**Why it fails**:
- Features don't market themselves
- Users don't discover features automatically
- Activation and adoption require intentional design

**What to do instead**:
- Plan distribution before building
- Design onboarding for feature discovery
- Create in-product announcements and education
- Measure feature adoption, not just usage

---

### Anti-Pattern 5: Copying Competitor Tactics Out of Context

**The mistake**: Implementing a growth tactic because a successful competitor uses it.

**Why it fails**:
- Context matters more than tactics
- What works for one product may destroy another
- You can't see their failed experiments
- Different stage, audience, and product dynamics

**What to do instead**:
- Understand WHY the tactic works for them
- Test in your context before committing
- Build your own playbook from first principles
- Learn from patterns, not individual examples

---

### Anti-Pattern 6: Optimizing Before You Have Volume

**The mistake**: Trying to optimize conversion funnels without enough traffic.

**Why it fails**:
- No statistical significance with low volume
- Small sample leads to false conclusions
- Optimization has diminishing returns
- Acquisition is usually the real problem

**What to do instead**:
- Focus on acquisition until you have volume
- Set minimum sample sizes for experiments
- Accept that early optimizations are directional guesses
- Build scale before optimizing

---

### Anti-Pattern 7: Treating Growth as a Team, Not a Function

**The mistake**: Isolating growth as a separate team disconnected from product.

**Why it fails**:
- Growth is embedded in product decisions
- Siloed teams create handoff friction
- Product teams lose accountability for growth
- Growth team becomes a bottleneck

**What to do instead**:
- Embed growth mindset across all teams
- Product teams own their growth metrics
- Growth team provides expertise and support
- Cross-functional collaboration on initiatives

---

### Anti-Pattern 8: Ignoring Churn for Acquisition

**The mistake**: Focusing exclusively on top-of-funnel acquisition while ignoring retention.

**Why it fails**:
- Leaky bucket: new users leave as fast as they join
- CAC increases as you saturate channels
- Retained users are your best acquisition channel
- LTV suffers, unit economics break

**What to do instead**:
- Balance acquisition and retention investment
- Fix activation before scaling acquisition
- Track cohort retention as primary metric
- Understand churn reasons before growing

---

### Anti-Pattern 9: Launching Referral Programs Too Early

**The mistake**: Implementing referral programs before achieving product love.

**Why it fails**:
- People won't refer products they don't love
- Referral programs can't manufacture word-of-mouth
- Incentives attract low-quality users
- Creates transactional relationships

**What to do instead**:
- Achieve organic word-of-mouth first
- Measure NPS and genuine recommendations
- Only launch referral to amplify existing behavior
- Focus on making the product worth referring

---

### Anti-Pattern 10: Building for Vanity Metrics

**The mistake**: Optimizing for metrics that look good but don't drive business.

**Why it fails**:
- Sign-ups ≠ Active users
- Page views ≠ Engagement
- Downloads ≠ Retention
- Growth metrics must connect to revenue

**What to do instead**:
- Define north star metric tied to value
- Track leading indicators of retention
- Focus on activated users, not registrations
- Measure what matters for unit economics

## Quick Reference: What NOT To Do

| Don't | Do Instead |
|-------|------------|
| Hire growth team pre-PMF | Founder-led growth until traction |
| Redesign site for performance | A/B test specific elements |
| Experiment on everything | Reserve experiments for uncertainty |
| Copy competitor tactics | Understand context, test in yours |
| Optimize low-volume funnels | Build volume first |
| Isolate growth team | Embed growth across teams |
| Ignore churn for acquisition | Balance both, fix retention first |
| Launch referral early | Achieve product love first |
| Chase vanity metrics | Track metrics tied to value |

## Expected Outcomes
- Avoided wasted resources on failing tactics
- Faster identification of what actually works
- Better prioritization of growth initiatives
- Realistic expectations for growth investments
