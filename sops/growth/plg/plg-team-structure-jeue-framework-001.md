## Metadata
- **Source**: Lauryn Isford (Head of Growth, Airtable) - Lenny's Podcast
- **Domain**: Growth / Product-Led Growth
- **Type**: Framework
- **Applicable To**: Growth leads, VPs of Growth, Product leaders building PLG teams
- **Company Stage**: Growth stage (Series B+), companies with PLG motion
- **Difficulty**: Intermediate

## Overview
The Join-Evaluate-Upgrade-Expand (JEUE) framework provides a structured approach to organizing PLG growth teams around the customer journey. This framework maps the user lifecycle from initial acquisition through expansion, enabling clear team charters, communication, and opportunity identification.

## When to Use
- Building or restructuring a growth organization for a PLG product
- Defining team charters and responsibilities in a multi-team growth org
- Communicating growth strategy across the organization
- Identifying gaps in your growth funnel coverage
- Planning growth investments and team priorities

## Prerequisites
- Product has some element of self-serve or freemium offering
- Company is at scale requiring multiple specialized growth teams
- Leadership alignment on PLG as a growth strategy
- Basic analytics infrastructure to measure funnel metrics

## Framework Components

### The Four-Stage PLG Funnel

#### Stage 1: Join
**Definition**: How customers become part of the product ecosystem

**User Actions**:
- Signing up as an individual
- Being invited by another user
- Finding the product through marketing/discovery channels
- Creating an account in an organization

**Team Responsibilities**:
- Acquisition optimization
- Landing page conversion
- Signup flow optimization
- Viral/referral mechanics
- Top-of-funnel awareness

**Key Metrics**:
- New signups
- Signup conversion rate
- Traffic sources
- Invitation acceptance rate
- Cost per acquisition

#### Stage 2: Evaluate
**Definition**: Users assess if the product delivers value for their needs

**Important**: This is deliberately NOT called "onboard" or "activate" because it focuses on what the user needs to see, not what the business wants them to do.

**User Actions**:
- Exploring core features
- Building initial workflows
- Testing product capabilities
- Determining product-use case fit
- Developing early habits

**Team Responsibilities**:
- Onboarding experience design
- Initial value delivery
- Education and guidance
- Time-to-value optimization
- Retention foundations

**Key Metrics**:
- Activation rate (e.g., week 4 multi-user active)
- Week 2/Week 4 retention
- Build sophistication score
- Time to first value
- User engagement depth

#### Stage 3: Upgrade
**Definition**: Users convert to paid or premium experiences

**User Actions**:
- Transitioning from beginner to intermediate/advanced usage
- Experiencing premium value proposition
- Self-serve credit card conversion OR
- Raising hand for sales conversation
- Moving from free to paid plan

**Team Responsibilities**:
- Monetization optimization
- Pricing and packaging
- Conversion flow design
- Premium value surfacing
- Churn prevention
- Billing and payment systems

**Key Metrics**:
- Free-to-paid conversion rate
- Average revenue per user (ARPU)
- Time to conversion
- Sales qualified lead (SQL) generation
- Payment success rates
- Downgrade/churn rates

#### Stage 4: Expand
**Definition**: Growth within existing accounts and organizations

**User Actions**:
- Additional team members adopting the product
- Expansion to new use cases
- Deeper integration into workflows
- Cross-team viral spread
- Renewal and upsell

**Team Responsibilities**:
- Within-account viral growth
- Multi-user collaboration features
- Enterprise feature development
- Net dollar retention optimization
- Referral program management

**Key Metrics**:
- Net dollar retention (NDR)
- Users per account
- Seat expansion rate
- Renewal rates
- Internal referral/invitation rate

## Implementation Steps

### Step 1: Map Current State to Framework
- Document your existing funnel metrics
- Identify which JEUE stage each metric represents
- Find gaps where you have no clear ownership or metrics
- Map existing teams to the framework stages

### Step 2: Define Team Charters
- Align each team to 1-2 primary framework stages
- Define clear ownership boundaries
- Identify overlaps and handoff points
- Set stage-specific OKRs

### Step 3: Establish Communication Patterns
- Use JEUE language consistently across the organization
- When proposing projects, name which stage(s) they impact
- Frame trade-offs in terms of stage prioritization
- Create stage-specific dashboards

### Step 4: Identify Opportunities
- Analyze each stage for improvement potential
- Prioritize based on business impact and team capacity
- Look for compound effects (projects impacting multiple stages)
- Revisit quarterly to assess if focus should shift

### Step 5: Build Stage-Specific Expertise
- Allow teams to develop deep domain knowledge in their stage
- Encourage cross-functional collaboration within stages
- Share learnings and best practices across stage teams
- Invest in stage-specific tooling and infrastructure

## Real-World Example: Airtable Growth Org Structure

**Acquisition Team** → Join
- Owned signup growth
- Landing page optimization
- Traffic source optimization

**Activation Team** → Evaluate
- Onboarding experience
- Guided flows
- Initial value delivery
- User education

**Monetization Team** → Upgrade
- Pricing and packaging
- Conversion optimization
- Churn prevention
- Billing systems
- Some overlap with downgrades

**Expansion Team** (emerged later as opportunity became clear) → Expand
- Within-account growth
- Enterprise customer expansion
- Multi-user adoption

## Expected Outcomes
- Clear team ownership and accountability
- Reduced cross-team confusion and duplication
- Faster identification of growth opportunities
- Better communication with cross-functional partners
- More strategic resource allocation
- Easier onboarding of new team members

## Common Pitfalls

### Pitfall 1: Treating Framework as Rigid Team Structure
**Problem**: Forcing exactly four teams when that doesn't fit your needs
**Solution**: Use JEUE as a conceptual framework, not a mandate. You might have 2 teams or 6 teams. Map them to the framework but don't force the structure.

### Pitfall 2: Static Team Focus
**Problem**: Working on the same stage forever even when opportunity shifts
**Solution**: Revisit framework alignment quarterly. Be agile. If one stage is healthy, shift focus to the next opportunity area. Teams can change focus.

### Pitfall 3: Ignoring Stage Interdependencies
**Problem**: Optimizing one stage at the expense of others
**Solution**: Understand how stages compound. Better evaluation leads to better upgrades. Better upgrades lead to better expansion. Set guardrail metrics.

### Pitfall 4: Over-indexing on Naming
**Problem**: Spending weeks debating perfect stage names
**Solution**: JEUE is just one framework. What matters is shared understanding, not perfect terminology. Adapt the language to your company culture.

### Pitfall 5: Missing Emerging Opportunities
**Problem**: Not adding new focus areas as the business evolves
**Solution**: Example from Airtable - Expand team didn't exist initially but became critical as enterprise customers grew. Revisit opportunities regularly.

## Metrics by Stage

| Stage | Primary Metrics | Secondary Metrics |
|-------|----------------|-------------------|
| **Join** | New signups, Signup conversion rate | Traffic sources, Viral coefficient, CPA |
| **Evaluate** | Activation rate, Week 2/4 retention | Build sophistication, Time to value, Feature adoption |
| **Upgrade** | Free-to-paid conversion, ARPU | Time to conversion, MRR growth, Churn rate |
| **Expand** | Net dollar retention, Seats per account | Renewal rate, Upsell rate, Cross-team adoption |

## Adaptation Guidelines

### For Earlier-Stage Companies (Pre-Series B)
- May not need all four teams
- Could have one growth person/team covering multiple stages
- Use framework for personal prioritization and focus
- Build team structure as you scale

### For B2B vs B2C
- B2B: Expand stage becomes more critical earlier
- B2C: Join and Evaluate often require more focus
- Enterprise: May need sales enablement within Upgrade/Expand
- Consumer: Viral mechanics in Join become more important

### For Different Pricing Models
- Freemium: All four stages apply strongly
- Free trial only: Evaluate and Upgrade blend together
- Enterprise-only: Join might be marketing/sales, less self-serve
- Usage-based: Expand becomes usage expansion, not just seat expansion

## AI Integration Notes

### Context Signals for AI
- User asks about "how to structure a growth team"
- User mentions "PLG organization" or "growth org design"
- Discussion of team charters or responsibilities
- Questions about growth funnel optimization
- Confusion about growth team ownership

### Application Guidance
- First assess: Does user's product have PLG motion? (Self-serve, freemium, or trial)
- Ask about company stage and team size to determine scope
- Map user's current state to JEUE framework
- Identify gaps before suggesting new teams
- Emphasize this is a communication framework, not a rigid structure

### Limitations
- Not applicable to fully sales-led businesses (no self-serve)
- Less relevant for very early stage (pre-product-market fit)
- Requires modification for non-SaaS business models
- Framework assumes horizontal product adoption patterns
