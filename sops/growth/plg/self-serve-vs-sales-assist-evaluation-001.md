## Metadata
- **Source**: Naomi Ionita - Lenny's Podcast
- **Domain**: Growth / Product-Led Growth
- **Type**: Framework
- **Applicable To**: Founders, Revenue Leaders, Growth Teams, Product Leaders
- **Difficulty**: Intermediate

## Overview
A framework for determining when to use self-serve PLG motions versus sales-assisted approaches, and how to effectively layer sales on top of a product-led foundation to maximize revenue while managing customer acquisition costs.

## When to Use
- When deciding initial go-to-market strategy for new product
- When PLG motion is established and considering adding sales team
- When trying to move upmarket from SMB to enterprise
- When optimizing revenue per account and expansion opportunities
- When evaluating trade-offs between user growth and monetization

## Prerequisites
- Product with established usage patterns and user base
- Understanding of customer segments and their willingness to pay
- Product usage data and analytics infrastructure
- Clear definition of your ideal customer profiles

## Procedure

### Step 1: Evaluate Growth vs Revenue Trade-offs
Determine your strategic priority:

**When to Prioritize Growth (Self-Serve PLG)**:
- Product has strong multiplayer/collaboration features
- Each new user increases value for existing users (network effects)
- Long-term bridge to enterprise is clear
- Individual users can become champions within organizations
- Top-of-funnel volume drives eventual enterprise adoption

**Example**: Figma gave away individual usage for free, knowing:
- Design is inherently collaborative
- Users interface with engineers, PMs, marketers, researchers, execs
- More than half of Figma users weren't even designers once embedded in enterprise
- Massive top-of-funnel led to exponential monetization later

**Key Insight from Naomi**: "If you know that you have a bridge to move up market, then giving up the long tail of individual users can be very worthwhile."

**When to Prioritize Revenue (Sales-Assist)**:
- Product is enterprise-focused from the start
- High-touch implementation or onboarding required
- Product solves critical business problems with clear ROI
- Willingness to pay is high at target segment
- Limited network effects or collaboration features

### Step 2: Identify Product-Led Sales (PLS) Opportunities
Evaluate whether you can layer sales on top of PLG:

**Product-Led Sales Indicators**:
- You have significant product usage data
- Free or low-tier users show enterprise-level engagement patterns
- Accounts exist that nobody on sales team is watching
- Usage patterns signal readiness to upgrade or expand
- Clear enterprise features justify sales involvement

**PLS Value Proposition**: "It's really free money when you shine a light on an account that nobody was paying attention to and some inside sales team can drive a large account expansion."

**Tools for Product-Led Sales**:
- Endgame (mentioned by Naomi - customers include Figma, Loom, Calendly)
- Pocus (noted for strong content and community around PLS)
- Other platforms that surface upgrade-ready accounts from product usage data

### Step 3: Map Self-Serve to Sales-Assist Journey
Design the progression from self-serve to sales involvement:

**Self-Serve Triggers**:
- First-time user signup and onboarding
- Individual or small team usage
- Standard pricing tiers and packages
- Automated upgrade flows
- Usage-based expansion within tier

**Sales-Assist Triggers**:
- Account reaches certain usage threshold (e.g., # users, # actions, data volume)
- Multiple teams within organization using product
- Enterprise feature requests (SSO, advanced security, custom contracts)
- High-value account signals (company size, industry, funding)
- Renewal approaching for significant accounts

**Hybrid Approach Benefits**:
- Lower CAC for initial adoption
- Sales resources focused on highest-value opportunities
- Product usage data informs sales prioritization
- Self-serve users pre-qualify themselves before sales involvement

### Step 4: Define Sales-Assist Criteria
Establish clear rules for when sales should engage:

**Quantitative Criteria**:
- Account has X+ users actively using product
- Usage frequency exceeds Y per week
- Account has been active for Z months
- Multiple departments represented in user base
- Approaching or exceeding current plan limits

**Qualitative Criteria**:
- Company profile matches ICP for enterprise
- Industry vertical with high expansion potential
- Executive sponsorship or executive users present
- Enterprise features requested in product or support tickets
- Competitive displacement opportunity

**Sales Motion Type**:
- **Inside Sales**: For mid-market accounts showing upgrade potential
- **Field Sales/AE**: For enterprise deals requiring customization
- **Customer Success-Led**: For expansion within existing paid accounts

### Step 5: Structure Pricing to Support Both Motions
Design pricing that accommodates self-serve and sales-assist:

**Self-Serve Pricing Requirements**:
- Transparent, publicly available pricing
- Clear value metrics users understand
- Self-service upgrade and payment flows
- No sales conversation required to get started

**Sales-Assist Pricing Requirements**:
- Custom enterprise plans above highest self-serve tier
- "Contact us" option for large teams or custom needs
- Annual contract options with discounts
- Ability to negotiate based on volume or commitment

**Key Principle**: Self-serve should not cap out too low. If self-serve maximum is too restrictive, you force sales conversations too early and create friction.

### Step 6: Implement and Measure Effectiveness
Track metrics for both motions:

**Self-Serve Metrics**:
- Free-to-paid conversion rate
- Time to first value
- Upgrade rate between tiers
- Monthly recurring revenue (MRR) from self-serve
- Customer acquisition cost (CAC) for self-serve

**Sales-Assist Metrics**:
- PLS-sourced pipeline value
- Account expansion rate
- Average contract value (ACV) for sales-assisted deals
- Sales cycle length for product-qualified leads (PQLs) vs cold leads
- Win rate on PLS opportunities vs traditional outbound

**Optimization Signals**:
- If PLS conversion is significantly higher than cold outbound, invest more in PLS
- If large accounts are churning without sales touch, lower PLS trigger threshold
- If sales team is overwhelmed with low-value opportunities, raise qualification bar

## Expected Outcomes
- Clear strategy for self-serve vs sales-assist motions
- Defined criteria for when sales should engage
- Product usage data feeding sales prioritization
- Optimized CAC across customer segments
- Higher revenue per account through targeted expansion
- Efficient allocation of sales resources to highest-value opportunities

## Common Pitfalls

### Pitfall 1: Too Early Sales Involvement
**Problem**: Requiring sales conversation before users experience product value
**Impact**: Friction in adoption, higher CAC, slower growth
**Solution**: Let users self-serve to aha moment, then layer sales for expansion

### Pitfall 2: Ignoring High-Value Self-Serve Accounts
**Problem**: No visibility into which free/low-tier accounts have enterprise potential
**Impact**: Leaving massive revenue on table
**Solution**: Implement product-led sales tooling to surface upgrade opportunities

### Pitfall 3: Self-Serve Pricing Cap Too Low
**Problem**: Highest self-serve tier is too restrictive, forcing unnecessary sales conversations
**Impact**: Creates friction for mid-market customers who want to self-serve
**Solution**: Design self-serve tiers to accommodate mid-market; reserve sales for true enterprise needs

### Pitfall 4: No Clear Sales Trigger Criteria
**Problem**: Sales team randomly engages accounts or misses opportunities
**Impact**: Inefficient sales resource allocation, inconsistent customer experience
**Solution**: Define explicit quantitative and qualitative criteria for sales engagement

### Pitfall 5: Treating Growth and Revenue as Binary Choice
**Problem**: Viewing PLG and sales-led as mutually exclusive
**Impact**: Missing opportunity to optimize both motions
**Example from Naomi**: "I don't think those are mutually exclusive."
**Solution**: Design hybrid model that leverages strengths of both approaches

## Real-World Examples

### Example 1: Figma's Growth-First Strategy
**Approach**:
- Free for individual designers
- Low friction to team collaboration
- Sales-assist for enterprise features and wall-to-wall deployment

**Outcome**:
- Massive designer community created product champions
- Collaboration features drove organic enterprise adoption
- Over 50% of users weren't designers once embedded in companies
- Exponential monetization once shifted to team/enterprise packages

### Example 2: Strategic Year-One Discounts
**Approach from Naomi**:
- Give early "design partner" users sweetheart discounts in year one
- Frame as early adopter benefit, not permanent free tier
- Get tight feedback loop to build right product
- Ensure payment starts by year two to understand willingness to pay

**Rationale**: "It is a journey, but I just oftentimes see companies just take too long [to monetize]."

## AI Integration Notes

### Context Signals for This SOP
- User asks about "PLG vs SLG" or "self-serve vs sales-led"
- Questions about when to hire sales team for PLG product
- Concerns about monetization in freemium model
- Discussion of moving upmarket or enterprise expansion
- Evaluating product-led sales tools or strategies

### Adaptation Guidelines
- **Early-stage startups**: Default to self-serve until clear enterprise traction
- **Enterprise products**: May need sales from day one if high-touch required
- **Mid-market focus**: Design for self-serve with sales assist option
- **Horizontal products**: More likely to benefit from pure self-serve
- **Vertical SaaS**: May need sales to understand industry-specific needs

### Key Decision Factors
1. **Network Effects**: Strong network effects favor growth/self-serve priority
2. **Implementation Complexity**: High complexity may require sales involvement earlier
3. **Willingness to Pay**: Clear high willingness to pay in target segment justifies earlier sales
4. **Product Data Availability**: Good usage data enables effective product-led sales

### Red Flags for AI
- Company has usage data but no PLS motion (opportunity cost)
- Sales team spending time on low-value leads while high-value accounts self-serve
- Self-serve pricing caps too low for target segment
- No clear criteria for sales engagement
