## Overview
A systematic framework for building and scaling word-of-mouth growth through exceptional product experiences. This approach achieved 70% of new customer acquisition through referrals at Wise by focusing on Net Promoter Score (NPS) optimization and creating 10x better products. The framework emphasizes that word-of-mouth growth requires blowing users' socks off with experiences they didn't know were previously possible.

## When to Use
- When you have low customer acquisition costs requirements (tight margins)
- When building products in commodity markets where differentiation is critical
- When traditional marketing channels are too expensive relative to your unit economics
- When your product has natural sharing moments or cross-border/network effects
- When scaling a product-led growth motion

## Prerequisites
- Ability to survey customers regularly
- Product analytics infrastructure to track behavior
- Engineering resources to invest in product improvements
- Long-term orientation (building word-of-mouth takes time)
- Clear understanding of your product's value proposition

## Procedure

### Step 1: Establish Word-of-Mouth Measurement
**Objective**: Create a reliable system to measure and attribute word-of-mouth growth

- Implement an attribution model that captures referrer data and cookie information from website visits
- Create a customer survey that asks "How did you hear about us?" integrated into the onboarding flow
- Survey a statistically significant sample of customers (not just all customers)
- Overlay survey responses onto web tracking data, particularly "direct traffic"
- Calculate word-of-mouth percentage: (customers who report hearing from friends) / (total new customers)
- Track this metric monthly to understand trends
- Set up automated reporting for the word-of-mouth percentage

**Expected Output**: A reliable metric showing what percentage of new customers discovered you through word-of-mouth

### Step 2: Implement Net Promoter Score (NPS) System
**Objective**: Create a leading indicator for word-of-mouth growth

- Deploy NPS survey asking "Would you recommend [Product] to a friend?" with 0-10 scale
- Send survey after key product moments (completed transaction, successful use case)
- Categorize responses:
  - Promoters: 9-10
  - Passives: 7-8
  - Detractors: 0-6
- Calculate NPS: % Promoters - % Detractors
- **Critical**: Include open-ended comment field after the rating
- Email NPS comments weekly to entire company (when small) or leadership team
- Analyze referral program data overlaid with NPS scores

**Expected Output**: NPS score with rich qualitative feedback, updated continuously

### Step 3: Discover the Exponential NPS-Referral Relationship
**Objective**: Understand how NPS correlates with actual referral behavior

- Overlay referral program invitation data with NPS survey responses
- Calculate invite rates and conversion rates by NPS segment:
  - Detractors (0-6): baseline referral behavior
  - Passives (7-8): typically 2x detractor referral rate
  - Promoters (9): typically 2x passive referral rate
  - Promoters (10): typically 2x score-9 referral rate
- Map the exponential curve: each NPS point increase doubles referral behavior
- Calculate viral coefficient by customer segment
- Model the ROI of NPS improvements vs. conversion rate improvements

**Key Insight**: Moving NPS from 30% to 50% increases the viral coefficient of your entire customer base, creating compounding growth that far exceeds one-time conversion rate improvements

### Step 4: Identify Your Product Pillars from Customer Feedback
**Objective**: Determine the 2-4 core attributes that drive recommendation

- Review all NPS comments systematically (hundreds or thousands)
- Look for patterns in what promoters mention repeatedly
- Look for patterns in what detractors complain about
- Identify the top 2-4 themes that appear most frequently
- Test hypothesis by sorting customers by specific attributes (price paid, speed received, ease metrics)
- Validate which attributes correlate most strongly with high NPS scores

**Common Patterns**:
- For marketplace/transaction products: Price, Speed, Ease of Use
- For B2B products: ROI, Implementation Speed, Support Quality
- For consumer products: Delight Factor, Reliability, Status/Identity

**Expected Output**: 2-4 clearly defined "product pillars" that drive recommendation (e.g., "Make it faster, cheaper, easier")

### Step 5: Set 10x Improvement Targets
**Objective**: Define what "blow their socks off" means for each pillar

- For each product pillar, research the current market standard
- Define the theoretical maximum/minimum possible for that attribute:
  - "What is the theoretical minimum cost for this service?"
  - "What is the theoretical maximum speed?"
  - "What would zero-friction look like?"
- Set target at 8-10x better than current market alternatives
- Document why this target represents "something they didn't know was previously possible"
- Validate target would drive 9-10 NPS scores through customer interviews

**Example (from Wise)**:
- Price: Market standard 6-7% → Target 0.5-0.65% (10x better)
- Speed: Market standard 3-5 days → Target instant (infinite improvement)
- Ease: Market standard 15-step process → Target 3 clicks (5x better)

**Critical Principle**: 10% better gets adoption. 10x better gets recommendation. Don't stop at "better" - aim for "didn't know it was possible."

### Step 6: Build Conviction Through Customer Insights
**Objective**: Develop deep certainty about what to build without endless A/B testing

- Conduct qualitative customer interviews focused on each product pillar
- Run targeted quantitative surveys on specific pain points
- Create small beta tests to validate directional impact (not full statistical significance)
- Build product manager gut feel through direct customer exposure
- Document the conviction narrative: "We believe [pillar] matters because [evidence]"
- Get organizational alignment on strategic bets before building

**Key Principle**: "You can't split test your way to love" - Engineering is expensive, and you can figure out what matters through customer insight before building extensive experiments.

### Step 7: Solve the Impossible Problems
**Objective**: Actually achieve 10x improvements by tackling systemic barriers

- Identify what makes 10x improvement "impossible" today
- Break down the constraint:
  - Regulatory/legal barriers
  - Infrastructure limitations
  - Technical challenges
  - Partnership/ecosystem gaps
- Assemble cross-functional teams including operations, legal, policy, engineering
- Commit to multi-year timelines for breakthrough improvements
- Celebrate small wins along the path to 10x

**Example Approaches**:
- Lobby regulators for new licensing (e.g., first eKYC license in Singapore)
- Build direct relationships with infrastructure (e.g., central bank accounts)
- Engineer away structural costs (e.g., automated verification vs. manual)
- Do unscalable things temporarily to prove the model (e.g., face-to-face verification while lobbying for digital)

### Step 8: Layer in Mission-Driven Advocacy
**Objective**: Add emotional connection beyond rational product benefits

- Clarify your authentic company mission (what problem are you passionate about solving?)
- Test if customers care: send mission-focused communications
- Measure forwarding/sharing behavior on mission content vs. product content
- Integrate mission into product touchpoints authentically
- Enable customers to help achieve the mission (lobbying, feedback, community)
- Hire people who personally experienced the problem you're solving

**Key Insight**: Rational benefits (faster/cheaper) drive initial recommendation. Emotional connection to mission creates evangelists who actively help you overcome barriers.

### Step 9: Close the Value Perception Gap
**Objective**: Ensure customers understand the 10x improvement you've delivered

- Identify gaps between delivered value and perceived value
- Create "product marketing within the product" to highlight improvements:
  - For speed: Visual animations showing instant completion
  - For price: Comparative graphs showing savings vs. alternatives
  - For ease: Celebration moments highlighting simplicity
- Place value communication at natural sharing moments
- Add one-click sharing capability adjacent to value highlights
- Test if perception gap closing increases referral rates

**Example (from Wise)**: Adding a comparison graph showing how much users saved vs. banks on the transaction success page, with a share button, increased referral rate by 300%.

### Step 10: Create a Word-of-Mouth Flywheel
**Objective**: Connect improvements into a self-reinforcing cycle

- Map the flywheel:
  1. 10x better product → Higher NPS
  2. Higher NPS → More recommendations
  3. More customers → More feedback
  4. More feedback → Better product understanding
  5. Better understanding → More 10x improvements
- Get customers involved in solving hard problems (lobbying, feedback, testing)
- Pass cost savings to customers (creating more word-of-mouth)
- Use word-of-mouth growth to avoid expensive marketing
- Reinvest marketing savings into product improvements
- Track flywheel metrics quarterly

## Expected Outcomes
- 50-70% of new customer acquisition through word-of-mouth referrals
- NPS scores of 60-70+ (compared to industry averages of 0-30)
- Exponential relationship between NPS improvements and growth rate
- Sustainable competitive advantage through product quality
- Lower customer acquisition costs than competitors
- Stronger customer retention and lifetime value

## Common Pitfalls

**Stopping at "better" instead of "10x better"**
- Most teams stop when their product works or is incrementally better
- This gets adoption but not recommendation
- Push through to "something they didn't know was possible"

**Over-relying on A/B testing**
- Testing everything slows down big bets
- Use customer insight and conviction to make larger changes
- Reserve testing for validation and risk mitigation, not discovery

**Ignoring the value perception gap**
- Customers may not realize how much better your product is
- Build "product marketing within product" to highlight differentiation
- Place value communication at natural sharing moments

**Taking shortcuts on hard problems**
- Plugging in existing solutions rarely achieves 10x improvements
- The "impossible" problems are what create defensible word-of-mouth growth
- Commit to multi-year timelines for breakthrough innovations

**Forgetting the mission element**
- Rational benefits alone may not create evangelists
- Authentic mission connection turns users into advocates
- But mission must be genuine - customers can detect inauthenticity

## AI Integration Notes
**Context signals that should trigger this SOP**:
- User asks about "word of mouth growth," "viral growth," "referral programs"
- User mentions low marketing budgets or tight unit economics
- User describes commodity markets or intense competition
- User asks how to measure or improve NPS
- User wants to build product-led growth motion

**How to adapt for different situations**:
- B2B products: Focus on ROI and implementation quality pillars
- Consumer products: Focus on delight and status/identity pillars
- Marketplace: Balance both sides of network for word-of-mouth
- Early stage: Start with Steps 1-4 to establish foundation
- Scale stage: Focus on Steps 7-10 for optimization

**Limitations and edge cases**:
- Requires product that can genuinely be 10x better (not possible in all categories)
- Takes 1-3 years to build true word-of-mouth engine
- Not suitable for products with inherently limited sharing moments
- May not work in markets with extremely high switching costs
- Cultural differences in recommendation behavior across geographies
