## Overview
Hiring your first PM is one of the most important decisions for a founder. The key insight: **your first PM should complement the founder's weaknesses, not replicate their strengths**. Most founders make the mistake of hiring someone like themselves or hiring too senior too early.

## When to Use
- Founder is stretched across product, sales, and operations
- Technical founder needs product thinking partner
- Company has achieved initial product-market fit
- Team size is 10-30 people
- Founder wants to delegate product decisions

## Prerequisites
- Clear understanding of founder's strengths and gaps
- Product-market fit (or strong signal toward it)
- Budget for a strong hire
- Founder willingness to delegate

## Core Concept: The Complementary Hire

### Why First PM Hiring is Different

**Regular PM hiring:**
- Fit an existing team structure
- Fill a defined role
- Clear scope and expectations

**First PM hiring:**
- Define the product function from scratch
- Work directly with founder(s)
- Ambiguous scope that evolves
- Must build credibility with early team

### The Founder-PM Complement

**Technical founder needs:**
- Customer empathy and research skills
- Market and competitive understanding
- Communication and stakeholder management
- Business and go-to-market instincts

**Non-technical founder needs:**
- Technical depth and feasibility judgment
- Engineering team credibility
- Systematic product process
- Analytical rigor

## Procedure

### Step 1: Map Founder Strengths and Gaps
Honest self-assessment first.

**Dimensions to evaluate:**
| Dimension | Strong | Weak | Notes |
|-----------|--------|------|-------|
| Customer empathy | | | |
| Technical depth | | | |
| Business/GTM | | | |
| Analytics/data | | | |
| Design sense | | | |
| Communication | | | |
| Execution/shipping | | | |
| Strategic thinking | | | |

**Ask yourself:**
- What do I naturally gravitate toward?
- What do I avoid or procrastinate on?
- What feedback do I consistently get?

**Ask your team:**
- Where do you wish you had more support?
- What decisions take too long because I'm the bottleneck?

### Step 2: Define the Role Scope
What will this PM actually own?

**Common first PM scopes:**
- **Full product**: Owns entire product roadmap (rare, high bar)
- **Core product**: Owns main product while founder handles new initiatives
- **Growth/activation**: Owns funnel optimization while founder owns core
- **Platform/infrastructure**: Owns internal tools while founder owns user-facing

**Questions to answer:**
- What decisions will they make autonomously?
- What requires founder sign-off?
- Who do they work with daily? (Eng, design, data)
- How will success be measured?

### Step 3: Set the Seniority Level
Match level to the actual job.

**Too Senior (common mistake):**
- Expects to set strategy, not execute
- Wants large team and resources
- May clash with founder on direction
- Expensive and harder to course-correct

**Too Junior (other extreme):**
- Needs more management than founder can provide
- Can't operate independently
- Limited pattern recognition
- Slower to build credibility

**Right level for first PM:**
- 3-7 years PM experience typically
- Has shipped products end-to-end
- Comfortable with ambiguity
- Can execute without heavy management
- Doesn't need to manage people yet

**Gokul's insight:**
> "The first PM should be someone who can do the job of a PM, not manage a PM team. You're not hiring a VP of Product yet."

### Step 4: Screen for Founder-PM Fit
Unique criteria for first PM role.

**Must-haves:**
1. **Ego-flexibility**: Can work with strong founder opinions
2. **Ambiguity tolerance**: Role will evolve significantly
3. **Execution bias**: Will ship, not just strategize
4. **Learning agility**: Industry expertise is less important than learning speed
5. **Communication clarity**: Will be voice of product to team

**Interview questions:**
- "Tell me about a time you disagreed with a founder/CEO. How did you handle it?"
- "Describe a project where the scope changed significantly. How did you adapt?"
- "How do you balance moving fast with making the right decision?"
- "What would you want to learn in the first 30 days here?"

**Red flags:**
- "I would build a team to..."
- "At [Big Company] we always did it this way"
- "I need clarity on scope before I can start"
- Questions primarily about title, reports, trajectory

### Step 5: Assess Product Judgment
Test actual product thinking.

**Product critique exercise:**
- Give them your product to use for a week
- Ask for written feedback: What would they change?
- Look for:
  - User-centric thinking
  - Prioritization instinct
  - Understanding of tradeoffs
  - Realistic scope

**Case study:**
- Present a real problem you're facing
- Ask how they'd approach it
- Listen for process and reasoning
- Not looking for "right answer"

**Live problem-solving:**
- Walk through a current product decision
- See how they think in real-time
- Do they ask good questions?
- Do they build on your ideas or dismiss them?

### Step 6: Check References Specifically
Standard references aren't enough.

**Who to talk to:**
- Engineers they worked with (not just managers)
- Designers they partnered with
- Founders/CEOs if they've been first PM before
- People who reported to them (even dotted line)

**Specific questions:**
- "How did they handle disagreement with leadership?"
- "What was their ratio of strategy vs execution?"
- "How much management did they need day-to-day?"
- "Would you want them as your PM in a startup?"

### Step 7: Design the Onboarding
First PM onboarding is different.

**First 30 days:**
- Shadow founder in all product contexts
- Meet every team member 1:1
- Deep dive into customer research/feedback
- Understand technical architecture basics
- Ship one small thing (build credibility)

**Day 30-60:**
- Take ownership of one defined area
- Run first product review with founder
- Identify first major initiative to lead
- Establish working rhythm with engineering

**Day 60-90:**
- Operating independently in owned area
- Founder can step back from daily decisions
- Clear metrics and review cadence established
- Trusted to represent product externally

## Expected Outcomes
- Founder time freed from product execution
- Product velocity maintained or improved
- Team has clear product point of contact
- Foundation for product team growth
- Better product decisions through complementary perspective

## Common Pitfalls

### Hiring for past experience, not learning ability
- Industry expertise matters less at early stage
- Pattern matching can be wrong in new context
- Look for adaptability and curiosity

### Not giving enough context
- First PM can't read founder's mind
- Over-communicate in early months
- Share the "why" behind every decision

### Micromanaging the hire
- If you can't trust them to decide, wrong hire
- Give space to develop their own style
- Disagree openly, then let them try

### Expecting immediate independence
- Even great hires need onboarding
- First PM needs to learn the product and team
- Plan for 90 days before full autonomy

### Unclear decision rights
- Founder and PM stepping on each other
- Define explicitly what each owns
- Revisit and adjust as trust builds

## AI Integration Notes

### Context signals that should trigger this SOP:
- Founder asking about first PM hire
- Early-stage company product hiring
- "When should I hire a PM?"
- First product hire decisions

### How to apply:
- Start with founder self-assessment
- Emphasize complementary skills, not replication
- Caution against too senior or too junior
- Focus on ambiguity tolerance and ego-flexibility

### Key insight:
Your first PM should fill your gaps, not mirror your strengths. Hire for learning agility and execution over industry expertise.
