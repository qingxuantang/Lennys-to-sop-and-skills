# Hiring Leaders Playbook

## Metadata
- **Source**: Gokul Rajaram - Lenny's Podcast
- **Domain**: Hiring / Leadership
- **Type**: Framework SOP
- **Applicable To**: CEOs, Founders, Executives
- **Company Stage**: Growth to Scale (0.5 to 2.0)
- **Difficulty**: Advanced

## Overview
Hiring senior leaders is fundamentally different from hiring individual contributors. The key insight: **the best leaders have a proven track record of building and scaling teams, not just individual excellence**. Most hiring mistakes at the senior level come from promoting great individual contributors or hiring impressive pedigrees without evidence of leadership impact.

## When to Use
- Hiring VP or C-level executives
- Promoting internal candidates to leadership
- Scaling a function beyond founder capability
- Building executive team
- Replacing departed leaders

## Prerequisites
- Clear understanding of what the function needs
- Budget for executive-level compensation
- Founder/CEO time for hiring process
- Board alignment on role (for C-level)

## Core Concept: The Leadership Hiring Triangle

### 1. Functional Excellence
Can they do the job at a world-class level?

**Evidence required:**
- Track record of results in the function
- Deep expertise in the domain
- Recognized by peers as excellent

### 2. Team Building
Can they attract, develop, and retain strong talent?

**Evidence required:**
- People they've hired who are now successful
- Track record of promotions on their teams
- Former reports who would work with them again

### 3. Organizational Influence
Can they operate effectively at the executive level?

**Evidence required:**
- Cross-functional leadership experience
- Experience influencing without authority
- Board or executive communication experience

## Procedure

### Step 1: Define What Success Looks Like
Start with outcomes, not activities.

**12-month success metrics:**
- What will be different in 12 months?
- What will we have shipped/achieved?
- What will the team look like?
- What problems will be solved?

**Document:**
| Dimension | 12-Month Target | How We'll Measure |
|-----------|-----------------|-------------------|
| Outcomes | | |
| Team | | |
| Process | | |
| Culture | | |

**Avoid:**
- Defining success by activities ("build roadmap")
- Vague goals ("improve product quality")
- Too many priorities (focus on 3-5)

### Step 2: Map the Must-Haves vs Nice-to-Haves
Not everything is equally important.

**Must-haves (non-negotiable):**
- Specific functional experience required
- Team size they've managed
- Stage experience needed
- Any hard requirements (location, etc.)

**Nice-to-haves (differentiators):**
- Industry experience
- Specific company background
- Network and recruiting ability
- Domain expertise

**Avoid:**
- Too many must-haves (limits candidates)
- Confusing pedigree with capability
- Requirements that aren't actually required

### Step 3: Source Through Networks
The best candidates aren't looking.

**Sourcing channels ranked:**
1. **Personal network**: People you or your team know directly
2. **Reference back-channel**: "Who's the best [function] person you know?"
3. **Investor networks**: Board and investor introductions
4. **Recruiter (retained)**: For confidential or very senior searches
5. **Inbound/LinkedIn**: Lower hit rate but can work

**Back-channel questions:**
- "If you were building a company, who would you want as your [VP Product]?"
- "Who's the best [function] leader you've worked with?"
- "Who's someone great that might be open to a change?"

### Step 4: Assess Through Multiple Lenses
One interview isn't enough.

**Interview types:**
| Type | What It Tests | Who Conducts |
|------|---------------|--------------|
| Vision/strategy | Strategic thinking | CEO/Founder |
| Functional deep dive | Domain expertise | Expert in function |
| Team case study | Leadership approach | CHRO or peer executive |
| Cross-functional | Collaboration | Other function leaders |
| Culture fit | Values alignment | Multiple team members |

**Case study approach:**
- Present a real problem you're facing
- Ask how they'd approach the first 90 days
- Probe on specifics: "How would you prioritize?"
- Look for questions they ask (what they need to know)

### Step 5: Dig Deep on Team Building
Past leadership behavior predicts future behavior.

**Key questions:**
- "Tell me about someone you hired who became very successful. What did you see in them early?"
- "Tell me about a hiring mistake you made. What did you learn?"
- "How many people from your previous team would you want to bring here?"
- "What's your approach to developing people?"

**Reference check questions:**
- "Would you work for [candidate] again?"
- "How did they handle someone on the team who wasn't working out?"
- "What was the caliber of the team they built?"
- "How did they develop you or others?"

**Red flags:**
- Can't name specific people they've developed
- Takes credit for team's work, not team's development
- Former reports don't endorse them
- Team turnover was high

### Step 6: Test for Cultural Fit
Values misalignment sinks executives.

**Cultural dimensions to assess:**
- Decision-making style (consensus vs. decisive)
- Communication style (transparent vs. need-to-know)
- Conflict approach (direct vs. diplomatic)
- Risk tolerance (move fast vs. careful)
- Work style (in-person vs. distributed)

**Assessment approach:**
- Ask about situations where their values were tested
- Present your company's approach, see reaction
- Have them meet diverse team members
- Look for genuine fit, not performance

### Step 7: Reference Extensively
More references, from more angles.

**Who to reference:**
- Former bosses (2-3)
- Former peers (2-3)
- Former reports (2-3)
- Others who know them (investors, customers, etc.)

**Back-channel vs. provided references:**
- Always do back-channels
- LinkedIn connections are fair game
- Ask provided references for other references
- Look for patterns across sources

**Reference red flags:**
- "I'd have to think about whether I'd work with them again"
- Hesitation on any core question
- Wildly different perspectives
- Can't find people who worked closely with them

### Step 8: Design the Offer and Onboarding
Set them up for success.

**Offer considerations:**
- Equity (significant for executives)
- Clear success metrics
- Reporting structure
- Resources and budget
- Decision authority

**Onboarding plan:**
- First 30 days: Listen and learn
- Day 30-60: Early wins and priorities
- Day 60-90: Team and strategy decisions
- Regular check-ins with CEO (weekly initially)

**90-day deliverables:**
- Assessment of current state
- Key priorities identified
- First hires/team changes (if needed)
- Quick wins delivered

## Expected Outcomes
- Right leader for the stage and needs
- Strong team-building capability
- Cultural alignment
- Clear success metrics
- Faster ramp to productivity

## Common Pitfalls

### Pedigree over evidence
- Big company name doesn't mean leadership ability
- Look for actual impact, not impressive resume
- What did they specifically accomplish?

### Promoting the top IC
- Great individual contributor ≠ great leader
- Different skills required
- If promoting, invest heavily in leadership development

### Rushing the process
- Bad exec hire costs 12-18 months
- Take time to get it right
- Keep interim solution if needed

### Not defining success upfront
- Vague expectations lead to misalignment
- Get specific about 12-month outcomes
- Document and revisit

### Ignoring cultural misfit signals
- "We can work around that"
- Cultural misfit at exec level poisons org
- Values are not negotiable

### Insufficient references
- 3 references isn't enough for exec
- Back-channels are essential
- Look for patterns, not just positive feedback

## AI Integration Notes

### Context signals that should trigger this SOP:
- Hiring VP or C-level
- Scaling leadership team
- Executive search process
- Senior hiring decisions

### How to apply:
- Emphasize team building as key differentiator
- Push for extensive references
- Focus on evidence of impact, not pedigree
- Ensure cultural fit is explicitly assessed

### Key insight:
The best executive candidates have clear evidence of building and developing teams, not just individual accomplishments. Past leadership behavior is the strongest predictor of future leadership success.
