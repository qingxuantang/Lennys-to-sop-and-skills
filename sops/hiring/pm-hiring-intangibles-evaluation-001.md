## Overview
A framework for evaluating product manager candidates beyond structured interview questions, focusing on intangibles like leadership presence, collaboration ability, and cultural fit. This approach addresses the common problem of candidates who can "pass the interview" but struggle to do the actual job.

## When to Use
- When hiring product managers, especially at smaller companies without extensive hiring apparatus
- When structured interviews are producing technically proficient but culturally misaligned hires
- When you need to assess whether a PM can inspire and lead cross-functional teams without formal authority
- When evaluating early-career PMs who will need to lead from day one

## Prerequisites
- Clear understanding of what the PM role actually entails at your company
- Agreement among stakeholders on the job definition
- Understanding that product management requires leadership without formal authority from day one

## Procedure

### Step 1: Define the Real Job Beyond the Job Description
Before writing the job description, clarify:
- What will this PM actually do day-to-day?
- What type of leadership is required?
- What collaboration challenges will they face?
- What is the actual environment and culture they'll work in?

**Key Question**: "Before we write the job description, let's talk about what the job is, because I'm not sure we all mean the same thing."

### Step 2: Balance Structure with Intangible Assessment
Structure your interview process to include:
- Technical/structured questions (skills verification)
- Behavioral questions that reveal leadership style
- Collaborative exercises with actual team members
- Open-ended discussions about work style and values

**Warning**: Don't let the interview become pure SAT prep where candidates can pass structured questions but can't actually do the work.

### Step 3: Evaluate Leadership Without Authority
Assess the candidate's ability to:
- Inspire engineers and designers without being their boss
- Show up and work with cross-functional teams
- Lead through influence rather than hierarchy
- Navigate ambiguity and fill gaps

**Key Insight**: "You are a leader from day one in product management. You don't have any formal authority, but you're a leader. You're expected to lead."

### Step 4: Assess the "Art" Skills
Evaluate candidates on:
- **Communication**: Can they articulate ideas clearly and compellingly?
- **Collaboration**: Do they create environments where others want to work with them?
- **Inspiration**: Would team members want to follow this person?
- **Storytelling**: Can they paint a vision?
- **Difficult conversations**: How do they handle conflict?

**Remember**: These "soft skills" are actually just as important, if not more important over time, as technical PM skills.

### Step 5: Verify Role Alignment
Ensure mutual understanding:
- **Ask the candidate**: "What do you think this role entails?"
- **Ask yourself**: "Does their expectation match our reality?"
- **Discuss**: What does product management mean at your company?

**Common Failure Mode**: "I thought I was hiring for this, but it turns out that's not even product management" or "I thought I was going to do this, but all they want me to do is build features."

### Step 6: Create Space for the Candidate to Interview You
Remember that candidates are interviewing you too:
- What kind of place do they want to work in?
- What don't they want?
- What's important to them about this role?
- How are they evaluating your culture?

**Key Principle**: "You are interviewing a place to plop yourself into. How are you approaching that to make sure you're making the right decision?"

### Step 7: Test Real Collaboration
Where possible, have candidates:
- Work on a problem with actual team members (not just present to them)
- Observe how engineers and designers respond to them
- See if they ask good questions and listen well
- Evaluate if the team would want to work with this person

## Expected Outcomes
- Hires who can actually do the job, not just pass interviews
- Better cultural and team fit
- PMs who can lead without formal authority
- Reduced early-stage attrition due to role misalignment
- More effective cross-functional collaboration

## Common Pitfalls

### Pitfall 1: Over-indexing on Structured Questions
**Problem**: Interview becomes SAT prep; candidates know exactly what questions they'll get and prepare accordingly.
**Solution**: Balance structure with open-ended exploration of work style, values, and collaboration approach.

### Pitfall 2: Neglecting to Define the Actual Role
**Problem**: Vague agreement on what the PM will actually do day-to-day.
**Solution**: Have explicit conversations about role definition before interviewing begins.

### Pitfall 3: Dismissing "Soft Skills" as Secondary
**Problem**: Treating communication, collaboration, and leadership as nice-to-haves rather than core competencies.
**Solution**: Elevate the "art" of product management to be just as important as the "science."

### Pitfall 4: Ignoring Cultural Fit
**Problem**: Hiring technically strong PMs who don't fit your company's way of working.
**Solution**: Be explicit about your culture and test for alignment throughout the process.

### Pitfall 5: One-Way Evaluation
**Problem**: Forgetting that the candidate is also evaluating you.
**Solution**: Create space for candidates to ask questions and assess fit from their side.

## Key Interview Questions

### Questions to Ask Candidates
1. **"How does your ideal company define a product team?"**
   - Reveals expectations about culture, collaboration, decision-making
   - Shows understanding of product management role

2. **"Can you pick an example of something you've shipped recently and talk about how it came to be?"**
   - Reveals actual process: sales-driven vs discovery-driven
   - Shows understanding of empowerment and product culture
   - Demonstrates how they navigate from idea to execution

### Questions Candidates Should Ask You
1. **"How does this company define a product team?"**
2. **"Can you walk me through how a recent feature came to be - from idea to launch?"**
3. **"What does leadership look like for a PM at this company?"**
4. **"How do PMs work with engineering and design here?"**

## AI Integration Notes
When advising on PM hiring, this SOP should be triggered when:
- User is developing a PM hiring process
- User mentions candidates passing interviews but failing on the job
- User is at a smaller company without extensive hiring infrastructure
- Discussion involves PM role definition or job descriptions
- User asks about evaluating "soft skills" or cultural fit

**Adaptation Notes**:
- For larger companies: Integrate with existing structured processes rather than replacing them
- For startups: Emphasize this approach as critical for first PM hires
- For scale-ups: Use to diagnose why current hiring isn't producing great fits
- Consider company stage: Earlier stage requires more emphasis on ambiguity tolerance

**Limitations**:
- This framework is more qualitative and requires experienced interviewers
- May be harder to standardize across many interviewers
- Requires clear internal agreement on culture and role definition first
- Works best when hiring managers have strong product backgrounds themselves
