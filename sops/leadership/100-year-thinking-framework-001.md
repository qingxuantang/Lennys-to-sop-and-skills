- **Type**: Framework
- **Applicable To**: Founders, CEOs, Product Leaders; All stages (especially growth and scale)
- **Difficulty**: Advanced

## Overview
The 100-Year Thinking Framework is a long-term decision-making approach that focuses on optimizing for enduring value rather than short-term metrics. By extending your time horizon to 100 years, you filter decisions through the lens of mission longevity, avoid value extraction, and make choices that compound positively over time.

## When to Use
- When facing strategic decisions about company direction or product roadmap
- When evaluating partnership opportunities or business model changes
- When pressure exists to optimize for short-term gains or quarterly metrics
- When deciding between tactical wins and positional advantages
- When tempted to "pull forward future profits at a discount"

## Prerequisites
- Clear articulation of your company's mission (the thing that will survive 100 years)
- Understanding that software products won't last 100 years, but missions can
- Acceptance that this approach may conflict with conventional business thinking
- Willingness to sacrifice short-term gains for long-term position

## Procedure

### Step 1: Anchor to Mission, Not Product
Define what will survive for 100 years:
- Not the specific software or product features
- The fundamental mission you're trying to accomplish
- For Shopify: "Make entrepreneurship more common"
- Ask: "What change do we want to cause in the world?"

### Step 2: Apply the Future Self Test
For any decision, ask:
- "What would we want to have done 20 years ago on this?"
- "What decision would our future selves want us to make today?"
- "Will this decision look wise in 10, 20, or 50 years?"
- Use future-casting to reverse-engineer current choices

### Step 3: Distinguish Positional vs. Tactical Game
Understand two types of business value:
- **Positional Game**: Territory on the map you're taking, trust you're building, role you play in customers' lives
- **Tactical Game**: Conversion optimization, A/B tests, immediate metric improvements
- Focus primarily on positional game; tactics are yours to deploy when position is strong
- If you extract all value through tactics, you hollow out your position

### Step 4: Evaluate Using Iterated Prisoner's Dilemma
For partnerships and customer relationships:
- Recognize every interaction as a repeated game
- On long timeframes (100 years), coordination always beats defection
- Resist the temptation to defect for short-term gains
- Build the corporate equivalent of turning away from the marshmallow

### Step 5: Create Levers, Don't Pull Them
For monetization decisions:
- Build as many monetization levers as possible
- Then don't pull them (or pull them minimally)
- Stay on the same side of the table as your customers
- Ask: "Would I leave if this happened to me?"
- Remember: "On a long enough timeline, playing positive-sum games with your customers is the ultimate growth hack"

### Step 6: Use "Don't Die" as Baseline
Balance long-term thinking with survival:
- Objective #1: Don't die
- Past that point, focus on the positional game
- Ensure sufficient tactical execution to avoid margin calls
- But don't let tactics consume the value you've created positionally

### Step 7: Rerun Your Decision Tree
When foundational assumptions change:
- Identify the "Boolean" foundational assumptions in your nested decision functions
- When core assumptions flip (e.g., "can people leave their house?"), rerun the entire tree
- Accept that the same quality decisions on each step can lead to radically different outcomes
- Example: Shopify's shift to remote work when COVID changed fundamental assumptions

## Expected Outcomes
- Decisions that compound positively over decades
- Stronger customer trust and loyalty (high customer lifetime value)
- Competitive moats that deepen over time
- Resistance to short-term competitive pressure
- More valuable long-term partnerships
- Product quality that reflects deep care and attention
- Company culture aligned around enduring mission

## Common Pitfalls
- **Confusing timeframe with inaction**: Long-term thinking doesn't mean not shipping or iterating fast
- **Ignoring survival needs**: "Don't die" is still rule #1; you can't reach year 100 if you don't survive year 1
- **Mistaking aesthetics for wisdom**: Rejecting sophisticated-sounding short-term thinking requires courage
- **Value extraction creep**: Gradually pulling monetization levers and not noticing the positional erosion
- **Path dependence blindness**: Making only "good" local decisions that lead to a local maxima
- **Dismissing as naive**: The framework sounds unsophisticated but requires deep discipline

## AI Integration Notes
Context signals that should trigger this SOP:
- User asking about long-term strategy or vision setting
- Discussions about short-term vs. long-term trade-offs
- Questions about partnerships, pricing, or monetization strategy
- Debates about quarterly goals vs. multi-year vision
- Concerns about competitive pressure to compromise values

How to adapt for different situations:
- For early-stage startups: Emphasize "don't die" more heavily, but still anchor to mission
- For growth-stage companies: Focus on positional vs. tactical distinction
- For mature companies: Apply to cultural decisions and market expansion
- For platform businesses: Emphasize positive-sum games and customer alignment

Limitations and edge cases:
- May not apply well to short-lived market opportunities or regulatory arbitrage plays
- Requires founder/CEO with conviction and board support
- Can conflict with investor expectations for near-term returns
- Assumes mission is actually worth 100 years of pursuit
