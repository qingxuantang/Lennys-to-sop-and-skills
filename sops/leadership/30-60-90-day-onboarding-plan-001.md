- **Type**: Process
- **Applicable To**: Anyone starting a new role (IC, manager, executive), especially leaders
- **Difficulty**: Beginner

## Overview
A structured framework for landing well in a new role by prioritizing listening and learning before doing. Consists of three 30-day phases: (1) Learning - conduct listening tour and diagnose, (2) Aligning - build shared vision for the future, and (3) Executing - deliver impact with earned trust. Prevents common new-hire mistakes of acting before understanding context.

## When to Use
- Starting any new job (internal transfer or external hire)
- Taking on significantly expanded responsibilities
- Joining a new team as manager or IC
- After major organizational restructuring
- When inheriting an existing team or product

## Prerequisites
- Agreement from your manager on this approach (share plan upfront)
- Time carved out for listening activities (20% minimum in first 30 days)
- Notebook or doc for capturing insights systematically
- Willingness to delay "quick wins" for deeper understanding

## Procedure

### Phase 1: Days 1-30 - Learning & Listening

#### Objective
Understand the landscape before making changes. Diagnose before you treat.

#### Step 1: Design Your Listening Tour
Create a list of people to talk to (aim for 30-60 conversations):
- **Direct reports** (if manager): All 1-on-1s within first week
- **Peers**: Product, engineering, design, data, marketing, sales leaders
- **Partners**: Key stakeholders, internal customers
- **Skip levels**: Team members below your directs
- **External**: Customers, partners, board members (if applicable)
- **Historical context**: People who left or moved roles

For each conversation, schedule 30-60 minutes.

#### Step 2: Prepare Your Listening Questions
Standard questions to ask everyone:
1. What's working well that we should protect?
2. What are the biggest challenges or frustrations?
3. What should I prioritize in my first 90 days?
4. What's one thing I can do to help you this week? (Small, immediate, specific)
5. What do I need to know that I won't learn from anyone else?
6. Who else should I talk to?

For engineering specifically:
- "What's one thing I can do to help you this week?"
- Focus on removing blockers, not making promises

#### Step 3: Take Extensive Notes
For each conversation, capture:
- Key themes and patterns
- Specific pain points
- Wishlists (write them down, even if they seem impossible)
- Contradictions (different people's perspectives)
- Language and terminology (how does this culture communicate?)

Deb's example: Someone gave her a wishlist of 5 things on day one. She completed all 5 over two years and sent a note: "Remember your wishlist? Done."

#### Step 4: Synthesize "State of the Union"
After 30 days, create a summary document:
- **What I heard** (major themes, patterns)
- **Key challenges** (as stated by the team)
- **Opportunities** (what people wish for)
- **My observations** (your initial hypotheses, tentative)
- **Open questions** (what you still don't understand)

Share this document broadly: "Here's what I heard from all of you."

Purpose: Demonstrate you're listening. Build trust. Get feedback on your understanding.

#### Step 5: Deliver Small, Immediate Wins
While listening, do small things:
- Help remove one blocker per person you talked to
- Fix one obvious broken process
- Introduce people who should know each other
- Share useful context or resources

Goal: Show you care and can deliver, without big commitments.

#### Step 6: Align with Your Manager
Share your State of the Union with your manager:
- "Here's what I'm hearing. Does this match your understanding?"
- "Are these the right problems to focus on?"
- "What am I missing?"

Get alignment before moving to Phase 2.

### Phase 2: Days 31-60 - Aligning on Vision

#### Objective
Build shared understanding of where you're going and how to get there.

#### Step 7: Draft Your Vision & Priorities
Based on what you learned, propose:
- **Vision**: What does success look like in 6-12 months?
- **Top 3-5 Priorities**: What must we focus on?
- **How we'll work**: Principles, processes, cadences
- **What we'll stop doing**: Say no to create space

Make it a proposal, not a decree. You're aligning, not dictating.

#### Step 8: Socialize and Refine
Take your draft to:
- Your manager (first - must have their buy-in)
- Your directs (if manager - they need to own it)
- Key stakeholders (they need to support it)

Ask: "Do we agree these are the right problems to tackle?"

Iterate based on feedback. This is collaborative, not top-down.

#### Step 9: Communicate the Shared Vision
Once aligned, share broadly:
- Team meeting or all-hands presentation
- Written document distributed to all stakeholders
- 1-on-1 follow-ups for key people

Make it clear: "This is what WE are committing to, based on what I heard from YOU."

#### Step 10: Define How You'll Work Together
Establish team norms:
- Meeting cadences (1-on-1s, staff meetings, all-hands)
- Decision-making processes (who decides what, how)
- Communication channels (Slack, email, docs)
- Feedback culture (how we'll give/receive feedback)

If managing a team, create explicit "communication contracts" (see related SOP).

#### Step 11: Identify Quick Wins for Phase 3
Choose 2-3 things to deliver in next 30 days that:
- Build on existing momentum
- Demonstrate progress on priorities
- Are achievable with current resources
- Show you can execute

### Phase 3: Days 61-90 - Executing & Delivering

#### Objective
Demonstrate impact and build credibility through execution.

#### Step 12: Ship Your Quick Wins
Execute the 2-3 things you committed to:
- Deliver on time (build trust through reliability)
- Over-communicate progress (visibility)
- Celebrate team contributions (build team cohesion)

This is proof you can deliver, not just diagnose.

#### Step 13: Establish Operating Rhythms
Lock in regular cadences:
- 1-on-1s with all directs and key stakeholders (weekly or biweekly)
- Team meetings (weekly)
- Broader stakeholder syncs (monthly)
- Skip-level 1-on-1s (quarterly)

Consistency builds trust.

#### Step 14: Begin Longer-Term Initiatives
Start work on bigger priorities from your vision:
- Assign owners
- Set milestones
- Create accountability
- Establish metrics

These won't complete in Phase 3, but you're demonstrating progress.

#### Step 15: Collect Feedback
At day 90, do a mini-retrospective:
- "What's working well in how I'm leading?"
- "What should I do differently?"
- "Are we making progress on our priorities?"

Adjust based on feedback.

#### Step 16: Reflect and Document Learnings
Write your own retrospective:
- What went well in your onboarding?
- What mistakes did you make?
- What would you do differently?
- What did you learn about this organization?

Deb published hers in her blog - the transparency builds credibility.

### Ongoing: Beyond 90 Days

#### Step 17: Maintain the Listening Practice
Don't stop listening after day 30:
- Regular skip-levels
- Quarterly listening tours (smaller scale)
- Anonymous feedback channels
- Stay close to the work

#### Step 18: Revisit Vision Quarterly
Every 3 months:
- Are we still focused on the right things?
- What's changed in the environment?
- Do we need to adjust priorities?

## Expected Outcomes

### For You:
- Deep understanding of organization, culture, challenges
- Trust from team and stakeholders (they feel heard)
- Clear priorities and mandate for action
- Avoided major mistakes from acting without context
- Credibility from delivering in Phase 3

### For the Team:
- Clarity on direction and priorities
- Feeling heard and valued (listening tour)
- Confidence in new leader
- Alignment across stakeholders
- Early wins build momentum

### For the Organization:
- Faster time to impact (ironically, by going slower at first)
- Avoided disruptive mistakes
- Stronger retention (people feel heard)
- Better decisions (based on real understanding)

## Common Pitfalls

### Pitfall 1: Skipping Listening to "Get Stuff Done"
**Problem**: Manager or company pressures you to ship immediately. "We don't have time for listening tours."

**Solution**:
- Negotiate upfront: "I need 20% of my time for listening. I'll deliver X with other 80%."
- Explain ROI: "I'll make better decisions and avoid costly mistakes if I understand context first."
- Share this plan with your manager before starting.

### Pitfall 2: Listening Without Hearing
**Problem**: Going through motions but not really processing what people say.

**Solution**:
- Take detailed notes
- Synthesize patterns
- Share back what you heard (proof you listened)
- Act on at least some of the input

### Pitfall 3: Making Big Commitments in Phase 1
**Problem**: Promising changes you can't deliver because you don't understand constraints.

**Solution**: Say "I'm still learning. I want to understand this better before committing to a path."

### Pitfall 4: Not Sharing Your Plan
**Problem**: People don't know you're intentionally listening first, think you're passive or slow.

**Solution**:
- Share this plan with team, manager, stakeholders
- Set expectations: "I'm doing a listening tour for 30 days, then we'll align on direction."

### Pitfall 5: Listening Forever, Never Acting
**Problem**: Analysis paralysis. Keep learning and never move to execution.

**Solution**:
- Stick to timeline (30-60-90, not 30-60-120-180)
- Commit to small wins in Phase 1
- Shift to action in Phase 3

### Pitfall 6: Not Customizing to Your Context
**Problem**: Following template rigidly instead of adapting.

**Solution**: Adjust based on:
- Role (exec needs more external conversations; IC needs more team conversations)
- Urgency (crisis mode needs faster timeline)
- Culture (move-fast cultures may need compressed 20-40-60 day plan)

### Pitfall 7: Ignoring the Problems You Found
**Problem**: Document issues but never act on them (erodes trust).

**Solution**:
- Prioritize what you can tackle
- Explain what you can't tackle and why
- Circle back to people who raised issues with updates

## Variations by Role and Context

### For Individual Contributors:
- Shorter listening tour (15-20 people, not 60)
- Focus on team, immediate partners, and customers
- Deliver small technical/design wins quickly
- Less formal "State of the Union" (maybe just share with manager)

### For Managers:
- Full listening tour (include skip-levels, peers, stakeholders)
- Establish team norms and communication contracts
- Focus on team health and effectiveness
- Build relationships with peer leaders

### For Executives/C-Level:
- Extensive external conversations (board, investors, customers, partners)
- More formal State of the Union (present to board or broader org)
- Vision needs to be more strategic and longer-term
- Organizational changes may be necessary in Phase 3

### For Crisis/Turnaround Situations:
- Compress timeline (maybe 20-40-60 days)
- Still listen, but act faster
- Prioritize "stop the bleeding" issues
- Be more directive (less collaborative) if needed for speed

### For Remote/Hybrid Roles:
- Schedule video calls, not just Slack messages
- Be more intentional about informal relationship-building
- Create async channels for input
- Travel to meet people in person if possible

## AI Integration Notes

### Context Signals That Should Trigger This SOP
- User mentions starting a new job or role
- Questions about "how to ramp up quickly"
- New manager asking how to establish credibility
- User feeling pressure to deliver immediately without understanding context
- Inherited a team or product with history

### How to Adapt for Different Situations

**By Timeline:**
- **Standard (90 days)**: Full framework as written
- **Fast-moving company (60 days)**: Compress to 20-30-40 days, same phases
- **Crisis (30 days)**: Listen for 1 week, align in week 2, execute weeks 3-4

**By Seniority:**
- **IC**: Focus on learning codebase, team dynamics, immediate deliverables
- **Manager**: Focus on team health, stakeholder relationships, organizational understanding
- **Executive**: Focus on strategy, culture, board/investor relationships, market position

**By Context:**
- **Internal promotion**: You know culture, focus on new scope and stakeholders
- **External hire**: You know industry, focus on company-specific culture and processes
- **Founder → hire**: Both culture and industry are new, need maximum listening

### Limitations and Edge Cases
- Some cultures don't value listening (move-fast-and-break-things) - adapt or reconsider fit
- Some roles truly require immediate action (e.g., firefighting) - do minimal listening, act, then circle back
- Some organizations are too broken for this to work (toxic cultures) - may need to act first to establish authority

### Example Prompts for Application
- "I'm starting a new job as [role]. Help me create a 30-60-90 day plan."
- "My manager wants me to ship something immediately but I don't understand the context. What do I do?"
- "I'm on day 30 of my new role. Help me create my State of the Union."
- "I did a listening tour and heard conflicting feedback. How do I synthesize this?"
- "I'm starting a role in crisis mode. Can I still take time to listen?"
