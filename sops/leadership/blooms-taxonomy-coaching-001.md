# Bloom's Taxonomy for PM Coaching

## Metadata
- **Source**: Bangaly Kaba - Lenny's Podcast
- **Domain**: Leadership / Coaching
- **Type**: Framework SOP
- **Applicable To**: Product Leaders, Managers of PMs, Engineering Managers
- **Company Stage**: All stages
- **Difficulty**: Intermediate

## Overview
When product managers or their reports struggle, the problem isn't always "they're not good enough." Bloom's Taxonomy provides a diagnostic framework to identify **where in the learning progression someone is stuck**: knowledge, comprehension, application, analysis, synthesis, or evaluation. The key insight: **if someone can apply a concept in one context but not analyze it across contexts, they need different support than someone who lacks basic knowledge**.

## When to Use
- Coaching underperforming team members
- Diagnosing why someone is stuck
- Designing development plans
- Managing managers (understanding where they need growth)
- Building skill development programs

## Prerequisites
- Understanding of the skills/concepts being evaluated
- Observation of the person's work
- Time for coaching conversations
- Commitment to development

## Core Concept: The Taxonomy Pyramid

### Six Levels of Cognitive Mastery

From basic to advanced:

**1. Knowledge**
- Recall of facts and basic concepts
- Can they name and define terms?
- Do they know the frameworks?

**2. Comprehension**
- Understanding the meaning
- Can they explain in their own words?
- Do they get why it matters?

**3. Application**
- Using knowledge in specific situations
- Can they apply the framework to their work?
- Have they used it successfully once?

**4. Analysis**
- Breaking down information into parts
- Can they compare and contrast uses?
- Can they apply across different contexts?

**5. Synthesis**
- Combining information into new patterns
- Can they create new applications?
- Can they adapt to novel situations?

**6. Evaluation**
- Making judgments based on criteria
- Can they assess when to use what?
- Can they critique and improve approaches?

### PM Application Examples

| Level | PM Skill: Prioritization |
|-------|--------------------------|
| Knowledge | Knows RICE, ICE, MoSCoW frameworks exist |
| Comprehension | Can explain what each framework does |
| Application | Has prioritized their roadmap using RICE |
| Analysis | Compares RICE vs. ICE for different situations |
| Synthesis | Creates custom prioritization for their context |
| Evaluation | Judges when prioritization matters vs. intuition |

## Procedure

### Step 1: Identify the Struggling Area
Pinpoint what skill or concept isn't working.

**Common PM skill areas:**
- Strategy and prioritization
- Data analysis and metrics
- User research and insights
- Technical understanding
- Stakeholder management
- Communication and influence
- Product craft and quality

**How to identify:**
- What tasks are going poorly?
- What feedback keeps recurring?
- Where does work product fall short?
- What questions can't they answer well?

### Step 2: Diagnose the Level
Determine where in the pyramid they're stuck.

**Diagnostic questions by level:**

**Knowledge check:**
- "Tell me about [framework/concept]"
- "What approaches exist for [skill area]?"
- If they can't name relevant frameworks → Knowledge gap

**Comprehension check:**
- "Explain why [framework] works"
- "What's the purpose of [approach]?"
- If they know it but can't explain why → Comprehension gap

**Application check:**
- "How have you used [framework] in your work?"
- "Show me an example of applying this"
- If they understand but haven't done it → Application gap

**Analysis check:**
- "When would you use [approach A] vs. [approach B]?"
- "How does this apply differently in [context X] vs. [context Y]?"
- If they've done it once but can't transfer → Analysis gap

**Synthesis check:**
- "How would you adapt this for our unique situation?"
- "What's missing from these standard approaches?"
- If they apply but can't adapt → Synthesis gap

**Evaluation check:**
- "When should we not use this approach?"
- "What would make you choose a different path?"
- If they can't critique or assess → Evaluation gap

### Step 3: Apply Level-Appropriate Development

**Knowledge gap interventions:**
- Share reading materials, articles, books
- Recommend podcasts and videos
- Provide definitions and overviews
- Create learning curriculum

**Comprehension gap interventions:**
- Discussion and questioning
- Have them teach it back
- Work through "why" questions
- Connect to their prior knowledge

**Application gap interventions:**
- Supervised practice
- Work through examples together
- Start with low-stakes applications
- Provide templates and scaffolding

**Analysis gap interventions:**
- Expose to multiple contexts
- Compare and contrast exercises
- Case studies across scenarios
- Pattern recognition practice

**Synthesis gap interventions:**
- Challenge to adapt approaches
- Novel problem solving
- Create new frameworks for their context
- Design exercises

**Evaluation gap interventions:**
- Critique exercises
- Judgment calls with feedback
- Meta-discussions about when/why
- Exposure to expert judgment

### Step 4: Check for Progression
Verify they've moved up the pyramid.

**Verification approach:**
1. Ask diagnostic questions at new level
2. Observe application in new situations
3. Look for transfer to different contexts
4. Note quality improvement over time

**Progression timeline:**
- Knowledge → Comprehension: Days to weeks
- Comprehension → Application: Weeks
- Application → Analysis: Months
- Analysis → Synthesis: Months to quarters
- Synthesis → Evaluation: Quarters to years

### Step 5: Apply to Managing Managers
Use the framework for manager development.

**Manager responsibilities:**
> "Managers responsible for basically owning that pyramid for all of the areas that they operate, but they need to be able to live at the top of the pyramid across all of them. They need to be able to synthesize and evaluate what's happening for each product team that they own."

**Manager development:**
- Managers should be at Synthesis/Evaluation level for their scope
- They should be able to diagnose where their reports are stuck
- They should apply level-appropriate coaching
- Their development is about breadth at high levels

**Example diagnostic:**
- Manager knows what their teams should do (Knowledge)
- Manager understands why (Comprehension)
- Manager has done it themselves (Application)
- Manager can analyze across their teams (Analysis) ← Required for managers
- Manager can create new approaches for org context (Synthesis) ← Senior managers
- Manager can judge when to deviate from standard (Evaluation) ← Directors+

## Expected Outcomes
- Targeted development interventions
- Faster skill progression
- Less frustration (right support at right level)
- Clear development tracking
- Better coaching efficiency

## Common Pitfalls

### Assuming knowledge equals ability
- "They should know this, they've read the book"
- Knowledge ≠ Application
- Many steps between knowing and doing
- Diagnose actual level

### Teaching at wrong level
- Teaching frameworks to someone who needs practice
- Giving practice to someone who needs concepts
- Wasted time and frustration
- Match intervention to gap

### Expecting immediate jumps
- "After one coaching session they should get it"
- Progression takes time at each level
- Particularly Application → Analysis
- Be patient with the process

### Only developing to Application
- "They can do it, job done"
- Analysis and Synthesis required for senior roles
- Evaluation required for leadership
- Continue development up the pyramid

### Ignoring context transfer
- Assuming one context = all contexts
- Analysis is about multiple contexts
- Test in different scenarios
- Don't declare victory too early

## AI Integration Notes

### Context signals that should trigger this SOP:
- "My PM is struggling with..."
- "They know it but can't apply it"
- "How do I develop my team?"
- Coaching and development questions

### How to apply:
- Identify the struggling skill area
- Use diagnostic questions to find level
- Recommend level-appropriate development
- Outline progression expectations

### Key insight:
When someone is struggling, don't just say "they're not good enough." Diagnose where in the learning pyramid they're stuck. Someone who knows the framework but can't apply it needs practice, not more reading. Someone who can apply in one context but not transfer needs exposure to multiple scenarios, not repeated practice in the same context.
