- **Type**: Framework
- **Applicable To**: Product Managers, individual contributors, managers at any level
- **Difficulty**: Beginner

## Overview
A framework for applying product management principles to your own career trajectory. Just as PMs create specs, roadmaps, and metrics for products, this SOP guides you to create the same intentionality for your career progression, preventing drift and enabling strategic decision-making.

## When to Use
- When evaluating job offers or role changes
- During annual career planning or goal-setting
- When feeling stuck or uncertain about career direction
- Before making major career transitions
- When comparing multiple opportunities that arrive at different times

## Prerequisites
- Basic understanding of product management principles (specs, roadmaps, metrics)
- Willingness to be honest about career aspirations
- Time for deep reflection (2-4 hours initial investment)

## Procedure

### Step 1: Write Your Career Spec
Create a document that defines:
- **Vision**: Where do you want to be in 5 years? What does success look like?
- **Skills Features**: What capabilities do you want to have? (e.g., scaled a team to 50+, launched 0-to-1 products, expertise in B2B sales)
- **Experience Milestones**: What roles, companies, or achievements matter to you?
- **Values/Constraints**: What's non-negotiable? (location, work-life balance, mission)

Example questions to answer:
- Do you want to be a founder, executive, board member, or IC expert?
- What skills are you missing to get there?
- What experiences would be transformative?

### Step 2: Define Your Career Metrics
Identify measurable indicators of progress:
- **Leading Indicators**: Skills acquired, relationships built, visibility gained
- **Lagging Indicators**: Promotions, compensation, titles
- **Learning Metrics**: New domains mastered, frameworks internalized
- **Impact Metrics**: Users affected, revenue influenced, teams scaled

Create a simple scorecard to track quarterly.

### Step 3: Build Your Career Roadmap
Map out stages like product releases:
- **Now - 1 Year**: What immediate skills/experiences to gain?
- **1-3 Years**: What roles position you for the next jump?
- **3-5 Years**: What major milestones lead to your vision?

For each stage, identify:
- Required skills to develop
- Types of roles that build those skills
- Companies/environments that enable that growth
- Relationships to cultivate

### Step 4: Create a Decision Framework
Establish criteria for evaluating opportunities:
- **Must-Haves**: Non-negotiable requirements
- **Scoring Matrix**: Weight factors like learning, impact, compensation, team quality
- **Direction Check**: Does this move me closer to or further from my 5-year vision?

When offers come serially (common in job searches), use this framework to evaluate each against your spec, not against each other.

### Step 5: Balance Learning and Impact
Consciously alternate between roles:
- **Impact Roles**: You know the domain well, can maximize results
- **Learning Roles**: You're stretching, acquiring new capabilities

Deb's pattern: Alternate between mastery (high impact) and growth (high learning) to build both credibility and capabilities.

### Step 6: Schedule Regular Reviews
- **Quarterly Check-ins**: Am I on track? What needs adjusting?
- **Annual Deep Dive**: Update 5-year vision, assess progress, revise roadmap
- **After Major Events**: Promotion, job change, or setback - what did I learn?

Use retrospectives: What went well? What didn't? What should I do differently?

### Step 7: Share and Get Accountability
- Share your plan with mentors, managers, or career partners
- Create accountability (like Deb's monthly writing commitment to Bos)
- Join or form a career support group for mutual coaching

## Expected Outcomes
- **Clarity**: Clear direction when opportunities arise
- **Agency**: Proactive career shaping vs. reactive drifting
- **Better Decisions**: Framework for comparing opportunities
- **Faster Progress**: Intentional skill-building accelerates growth
- **Reduced Regret**: Confidence you're making aligned choices

## Common Pitfalls

### Pitfall 1: No Plan at All
**Problem**: Being the "best PM for products but worst PM for your career" - drifting from opportunity to opportunity with no intentionality.

**Solution**: Even a rough plan is better than none. Start with just your 5-year vision and one metric.

### Pitfall 2: Over-Optimization for Current State
**Problem**: Taking roles that maximize today's strengths but don't build new capabilities.

**Solution**: Balance impact and learning. Deliberately take roles where you're "not qualified" to force growth.

### Pitfall 3: Serial Decision-Making Without Framework
**Problem**: Each job offer comes at different times, making comparison impossible. You evaluate in isolation: "Is this good?" vs. "Does this fit my plan?"

**Solution**: Your spec becomes the constant measuring stick for serial decisions.

### Pitfall 4: Hindsight Bias
**Problem**: "Things worked out for me without planning" - survivorship bias. Many talented people drift into suboptimal outcomes.

**Solution**: Acknowledge luck's role but don't rely on it. Planning increases odds of success.

### Pitfall 5: Plan Becomes Rigid
**Problem**: Sticking to outdated vision when circumstances or desires change.

**Solution**: Roadmaps are living documents. Annual reviews should include "Do I still want this?"

## AI Integration Notes

### Context Signals That Should Trigger This SOP
- User mentions career uncertainty, job offers, or feeling "stuck"
- Questions like "Should I take this role?" or "How do I decide?"
- Patterns of reactive decision-making in conversation
- User is a PM but lacks career direction

### How to Adapt for Different Situations

**For Early Career (0-3 years)**:
- Focus on skill acquisition over titles
- Vision can be broader ("I want to be great at product")
- Emphasize learning over impact

**For Mid Career (3-10 years)**:
- More specific vision needed ("I want to lead growth at a Series B")
- Balance learning and impact equally
- Consider specialization vs. generalization

**For Senior Career (10+ years)**:
- Vision often involves leadership, boards, or founding
- Focus on legacy and impact
- Relationships become critical metric

**For Career Transitions**:
- May need to restart "learning" phase
- Vision might involve domain change
- Previous impact provides credibility for stretch

### Limitations and Edge Cases
- Framework assumes agency (may not apply in constrained circumstances)
- Requires self-awareness (some may need coaching to develop vision)
- Cultural contexts vary (individualistic vs. collectivist career planning)
- Works best in growth markets (limited in declining industries)

### Example Prompts for Application
- "I have two job offers. Help me evaluate them using a career PM framework."
- "I feel like I'm drifting in my career. Help me create a 5-year spec."
- "I'm not sure if this opportunity moves me forward. How do I decide?"
