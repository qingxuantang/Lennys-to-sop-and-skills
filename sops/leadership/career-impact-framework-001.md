# Career Impact Framework

## Metadata
- **Source**: Bangaly Kaba - Lenny's Podcast
- **Domain**: Leadership / Career Development
- **Type**: Framework SOP
- **Applicable To**: Product Managers, Engineers, All ICs, Managers
- **Company Stage**: All stages
- **Difficulty**: Beginner to Intermediate

## Overview
Compensation, leveling, and scope are all derivatives of one thing: impact. The Career Impact Framework provides an objective way to assess what's limiting your impact: **Impact = Environment × Skills**. The key insight: **your manager is the most important environmental variable because they have the power to fix most other environmental factors**.

## When to Use
- Feeling stuck in your career
- Deciding whether to stay or leave
- Annual career self-assessment
- Diagnosing why impact is limited
- Evaluating job opportunities
- Preparing for career conversations

## Prerequisites
- Honest self-reflection
- Willingness to score yourself objectively
- Understanding of your current role
- Access to manager for discussion

## Core Concept: Impact = Environment × Skills

### Why Impact is the Key Metric

**What impact enables:**
- Compensation increases (reflection of impact)
- Leveling and promotions (derivative of impact)
- Scope expansion (earned through demonstrated impact)
- Career growth (built on track record of impact)

**The formula:**
```
Impact = Environment × Skills
```

Both must be strong. Great skills in a bad environment = limited impact. Great environment with skill gaps = limited impact.

### The Six Environment Variables
Score each from 0 to 2 in 0.25 increments.

**1. Manager (Most Important)**
- Quality of your direct manager
- Their ability to support and advocate
- Communication and empathy
- Their own standing in organization

**2. Resources**
- Team staffing appropriateness
- Budget and P&L access
- Tools and infrastructure
- Cross-functional support

**3. Scope**
- Remit size and importance
- Ability to work on impactful problems
- Balance (not too narrow, not overwhelming)
- Strategic relevance

**4. Team**
- Relative skills of team members
- Team dynamics and culture
- Collaboration effectiveness
- Complementary capabilities

**5. Compensation**
- Fair market compensation
- Feeling valued financially
- Alignment with contribution
- Equity/upside potential

**6. Company Culture**
- Supportive and inclusive environment
- Ability to do your best work
- Values alignment
- Growth opportunities

### The Four Skill Variables
Score each from 0 to 2 in 0.25 increments.

**1. Communication (Most Important)**
- Written and verbal clarity
- Storytelling and persuasion
- Listening and synthesis
- Adapting to audience

**2. Influence**
- Building alignment without authority
- Managing up effectively
- Cross-functional partnerships
- Political navigation

**3. Strategic Thinking**
- Connecting work to business outcomes
- Long-term vision
- Pattern recognition
- Trade-off analysis

**4. Execution**
- Actually getting things done
- Delivering results consistently
- Working through obstacles
- Quality of output

## Procedure

### Step 1: Score Your Environment
Rate each variable honestly.

**Scoring scale:**
- 0-0.5: Significantly hindering your impact
- 0.75-1.0: Neutral, not helping or hurting
- 1.25-1.5: Moderately beneficial
- 1.75-2.0: Greatly benefiting your impact

**Environment assessment:**
| Variable | Score | Evidence/Reasoning |
|----------|-------|-------------------|
| Manager | | |
| Resources | | |
| Scope | | |
| Team | | |
| Compensation | | |
| Culture | | |
| **Total** | /12 | |

**Honesty check:**
> "Part of what makes this framework so powerful is that it helps you to be honest around what are the things that are limiting your ability to have impact."

### Step 2: Score Your Skills
Rate each skill variable honestly.

**Skills assessment:**
| Variable | Score | Evidence/Reasoning |
|----------|-------|-------------------|
| Communication | | |
| Influence | | |
| Strategic Thinking | | |
| Execution | | |
| **Total** | /8 | |

**Calibration tip:**
Ask for manager or peer feedback on these — self-assessment is often biased.

### Step 3: Identify Low Scores
Find what's limiting your impact.

**Analysis questions:**
- Which scores are below 1.0?
- Which have the biggest gap from 2.0?
- Which could be improved most easily?
- Which are most important for your role?

**Prioritization:**
Not all variables are equal. Manager is most important in environment; communication is most important in skills.

### Step 4: Assess Changeability
For each low score, evaluate if you can change it.

**Environment changeability:**
| Variable | Can You Change It? | How? |
|----------|-------------------|------|
| Manager | Sometimes | Request transfer, influence relationship, wait for reorg |
| Resources | Rarely alone | Make case to leadership, get manager support |
| Scope | Sometimes | Propose expansion, demonstrate capability |
| Team | Rarely | Hire recommendations, skill building |
| Compensation | Yes | Negotiate, job search leverage |
| Culture | Rarely | Limited to team-level influence |

**Skills changeability:**
All skills are within your control to improve through:
- Mentorship (3-4 mentors, rotating)
- Voracious learning (podcasts, blogs, books)
- Deliberate practice
- Watching and stealing from others

### Step 5: Communicate with Your Manager
The manager can influence most environmental factors.

**Conversation framework:**
1. Share your assessment (professionally)
2. Tie low scores to impact limitation
3. Ask for help creating a plan
4. Follow up on progress

**Template:**
> "I've been thinking about how to have more impact. I believe [X environment factor] is currently limiting me because [specific reason]. Could we discuss how to address this? I think if we could [specific action], I could deliver [specific outcome]."

**Key insight:**
> "People say they don't leave a job, they leave a manager because the manager is the one that has a lot of the power to fix a lot of these variables."

### Step 6: Decide: Fix or Leave
Based on assessment and changeability.

**Stay and fix if:**
- Low scores are changeable
- Manager is supportive and can help
- Company/role fundamentals are good
- You believe in the trajectory

**Consider leaving if:**
- Manager is the low score
- Multiple environment factors are unfixable
- Culture is fundamentally misaligned
- No path to improvement visible

**Before leaving:**
> "Talk to not only the people there but the people who've left. The people who left will tell you what the worst version or their version is, and it's on you to triangulate that information."

### Step 7: Annual Review
Repeat this assessment yearly.

**Annual practice:**
- Score all variables fresh
- Compare to previous year
- Note what changed and why
- Plan next year's focus areas
- Adjust strategy based on trajectory

## Expected Outcomes
- Clearer understanding of career blockers
- Better conversations with manager
- More strategic career decisions
- Faster career progression
- Reduced frustration and uncertainty

## Common Pitfalls

### Blaming only environment
- "It's not my fault, it's the company"
- Both environment AND skills matter
- What skills could you improve?
- Be honest about your contribution

### Blaming only yourself
- "I just need to work harder"
- Environment can genuinely limit you
- Even great skills can't overcome bad environment
- Assess both fairly

### Not talking to manager
- Suffering in silence
- Assuming they know
- Manager often unaware of your assessment
- Most problems need manager involvement to solve

### Optimizing for compensation only
- "I just need to make more money"
- Compensation follows impact
- Fix impact drivers first
- Money often follows naturally

### Ignoring the manager variable
- Manager is most leveraged variable
- Bad manager = hard to fix anything else
- Good manager = can fix most things
- Don't underweight this

## AI Integration Notes

### Context signals that should trigger this SOP:
- "Should I leave my job?"
- "I'm not having impact"
- "I feel stuck"
- Career advice requests

### How to apply:
- Walk through environment scoring
- Walk through skills scoring
- Identify limiting factors
- Develop action plan

### Key insight:
Impact is the north star metric for your career. Everything else — compensation, leveling, scope — follows from impact. The formula Impact = Environment × Skills gives you a diagnostic tool: find what's limiting your impact, assess if you can change it, and either fix it or find a better environment.
