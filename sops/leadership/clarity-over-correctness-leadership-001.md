- **Source**: Tomer Cohen (CPO, LinkedIn) - Lenny's Podcast
- **Domain**: Leadership & Decision-Making
- **Type**: Framework
- **Applicable To**: Product leaders, team leads, managers at all levels, anyone leading through ambiguity
- **Difficulty**: Intermediate

## Overview
A leadership philosophy and operating principle that prioritizes organizational clarity and alignment over being right, enabling teams to move with conviction even in uncertainty. This framework addresses the paralysis that comes from hedge-betting and helps teams "pull through in the same direction" rather than scatter energy across multiple possibilities.

## When to Use
- Leading teams through ambiguous situations with no clear "right answer"
- Experiencing organizational hedging (people pursuing different directions despite decisions)
- Dealing with alpha-type teammates attached to being right
- Facing urgent situations requiring unified action
- Building cultures that value speed and conviction
- Product decisions with limited data requiring best judgment
- Strategic choices where waiting for certainty means missing opportunity

## Prerequisites
- Authority to make or influence decisions in your domain
- Willingness to be wrong publicly
- Ability to articulate thinking clearly
- Team that respects thoughtful reasoning even when disagreeing
- Culture where failure is learning opportunity

## Procedure

### Step 1: Understand the Philosophy
**Objective**: Internalize why clarity matters more than correctness

**Core Insight**:
"Pulling through in the same direction doesn't mean you're going to be successful, but this gives you a chance of success. Confusion in the system means only luck can save you."

**Key Distinctions**:
- **Being Right**: Attached to specific outcome or solution
- **Clarity of Thought**: Clear understanding of problem and proposed approach
- **Clarity of Execution**: Resources and actions aligned to decision

**Origin Story** (Tomer's):
Met a startup founder whose company was near failure. After deciding on a path forward, he saw people hedging in different directions. Realized that unless everyone pulled in the same direction, no chance of success. Success requires aligned execution, not perfect decisions.

**Personal Impact**:
"It comes from a humble place. I would rather go forward with everybody in the same direction than hedge all the time, which will give me no chance of success."

### Step 2: Separate Misunderstanding from Disagreement
**Objective**: Stop confusion from masking as disagreement

**Problem Identified**:
People often say "I don't exactly understand" when they actually disagree. This creates false alignment and wastes time.

**The Question to Ask**:
"Are you disagreeing or misunderstanding?"

**If Misunderstanding**:
1. Each person articulates the other's point of view in their own words
2. Continue until both can represent each other's perspective accurately
3. Only then move to discussion

**If Disagreeing**:
1. Stop trying to explain better
2. Move directly to debate/decision
3. Don't waste time on false "understanding" exercises

**Cultural Note**:
Tomer came from Israel where "arguing is the love language" to US where people mask disagreement. Learned to push back directly: "Are you disagreeing or not clear?"

### Step 3: Invest in Clarity of Thought
**Objective**: Develop clear problem definition and principled solutions

**Problem Definition Phase**:
- Spend significant time on: What EXACTLY is the problem?
- Not high-level ("we need a video product")
- Specific: What type? For which audience? What unique criteria? What are you trying to enable?
- "Once you see the problem, you should be able to imagine that mountain - not just 'a mountain' but the exact road and base camp"

**Solution Phase - First Principles**:
- Base solutions on principles, not just features
- Seek opinions, even controversial ones
- Best principles have "teeth" (trade-offs)

**Example of Weak Principle**:
"We should build a simple product" (who doesn't want that?)

**Example of Strong Principle**:
"I'm willing to sacrifice [X] to achieve [Y]" - Now we have teeth, can discuss the trade-off

**The Clarity Test**:
Can you articulate:
1. The specific problem you're solving?
2. The principle behind your solution?
3. The trade-offs you're making?
4. What success looks like?

If no to any, you're not ready to proceed.

### Step 4: Build Clarity of Execution
**Objective**: Ensure decisions translate into actual work

**Diagnosis Questions**:
1. "What's your top priority?"
2. "Where are most of your engineers working?"
3. "Where is your top talent working?"

**Common Disconnect**:
- Leader says: "My top priority is initiative X"
- Reality: Most engineers working on migration Y
- Response: "So why don't you say the migration is your #1 priority?"

**Alignment Process**:
1. State priorities clearly
2. Audit resource allocation (people, time, budget)
3. Identify mismatches
4. Reallocate or restate priorities
5. Verify top talent working on top priorities

**Meeting Quality Check**:
"How often do you leave a meeting unclear about:
- What problem was discussed?
- What was decided?
- What are next steps?

If often, you have execution clarity problem."

### Step 5: State Your Position Clearly
**Objective**: Make decisions visible and debatable

**Format**: "We might be wrong, but we are not confused."

**What to State**:
1. **The Problem**: Specific issue we're addressing
2. **Our Approach**: Solution we're pursuing
3. **Key Principles**: Trade-offs we're making
4. **What We're NOT Doing**: Equally important
5. **Success Criteria**: How we'll know if it worked
6. **Our Conviction Level**: How certain we are (but committed regardless)

**Example Structure**:
"Here's the problem: [specific problem]
Here's our approach: [principled solution]
We're willing to trade off: [clear sacrifices]
We're NOT doing: [alternatives we rejected]
Success looks like: [measurable outcomes]
We might be wrong about [X and Y], but we're not confused about our direction."

**Delivery**:
- Share in writing for complex decisions
- Verbal for tactical decisions
- Always open for Socratic debate
- But once decided, unified execution

### Step 6: Enable Socratic Debate
**Objective**: Create space for challenge without creating confusion

**Environment Creation**:
- Make it safe to challenge with evidence/logic
- Distinguish between debate phase and execution phase
- Encourage "controversial opinions"
- Reward principle-based arguments
- Don't punish being wrong; punish being unclear

**Question to Encourage**:
"What is actually your opinion? What is your potentially controversial opinion?"

**Response to Disagreement**:
"I love this. This is exactly the conversation we should have."

**Debate Rules**:
1. Attack ideas, not people
2. Base on principles, not preferences
3. Make trade-offs explicit
4. Time-box the debate
5. Once decided, unity in execution

**Liberating Effect** (from Josh Redfern quote):
"This phrase became really liberating... forces you to make a call and be aligned and make sure everyone is on the same page."

### Step 7: Execute with Unity
**Objective**: Once decided, move as one

**After Decision**:
1. Restate what was decided
2. Confirm everyone understands (not necessarily agrees)
3. Commit to the direction collectively
4. Stop hedging or pursuing alternatives
5. Allocate resources fully to the decision

**If Someone Continues Hedging**:
"We made a decision. We might be wrong, but we're not confused. Are you unclear on what we decided, or are you disagreeing with executing it?"

**If Disagreeing with Execution**:
That's a problem. Either reopen decision (rare, high bar) or need alignment on execution.

**Measurement**:
- Are resources actually flowing to the priority?
- Are meetings about execution, not relitigating decision?
- Is progress visible weekly?

### Step 8: Learn and Iterate
**Objective**: Use clarity to enable learning

**Why This Matters for Learning**:
"If you don't know exactly what you're doing, how can you learn back from why you made that decision?"

**Learning Process**:
1. Document what you decided and why (with principles)
2. Track outcomes against success criteria
3. Regular check-ins: Are we still confident? What's changed?
4. When you discover you were wrong: Acknowledge quickly
5. Update understanding, make new clear decision
6. Share learning: "Here's what we learned, here's new direction"

**Growth Organization Mindset**:
"This is not a one-off project. We're going to build many projects in the future. If you're not sure about what we were trying to accomplish, how can you know what you learned?"

### Step 9: Apply to Product Jams/Reviews
**Objective**: Structure critical meetings for clarity

**Product Jam Process** (Tomer's approach):
1. **Problem Phase**: Significant time on exact problem definition
   - Not high-level
   - Specific audience, criteria, nuance
   - Can visualize the mountain peak

2. **Solution Phase**: First principles approach
   - What's your opinion?
   - What trade-offs are you making?
   - Challenge: "Saying we should build a simple product is useless"
   - Push for: "What are you willing to sacrifice?"

3. **Clarity Check**: Before leaving the room
   - Can everyone articulate the problem?
   - Can everyone explain the principle?
   - Do we know what we're NOT doing?
   - Are next steps crystal clear?

**Frequency During Transformation**:
"Usually I do product jams for multiple topics throughout the quarter. During transformation, I did them every week on our top 5 bets - nothing else - because it was so important."

## Expected Outcomes
- Faster decision-making (less time spent in false consensus)
- Clearer communication across organization
- Better learning (know what you decided and why)
- More confident execution (even when wrong)
- Reduced political hedging
- Easier post-mortems (clear decisions enable clear analysis)
- Attractive culture for alpha-types who want clarity over correctness

## Common Pitfalls

### Pitfall 1: Confusing Clarity with Certainty
**Problem**: Thinking you need to be certain before being clear
**Solution**: You can be clear about approach while uncertain about outcome

### Pitfall 2: Using Clarity to Avoid Debate
**Problem**: "We've decided, no more discussion"
**Solution**: Clarity enables better debate; encourage Socratic conversation before and during

### Pitfall 3: No Teeth in Principles
**Problem**: Stating obvious things everyone agrees with
**Solution**: Force trade-offs: "What are you willing to sacrifice?"

### Pitfall 4: Stating Position but Not Executing
**Problem**: Clear words but confused resource allocation
**Solution**: Audit where people actually work, not what leaders say

### Pitfall 5: Punishing Being Wrong
**Problem**: Despite "might be wrong" language, culture punishes mistakes
**Solution**: Explicitly reward clear thinking that led to wrong answer; punish unclear thinking

### Pitfall 6: Reopening Decisions Too Often
**Problem**: Every meeting relitigates the same decision
**Solution**: Set high bar for reopening; default to execution

### Pitfall 7: Forcing Agreement
**Problem**: Need everyone to agree before moving
**Solution**: Need clarity and commitment, not agreement

### Pitfall 8: Skipping the "Why"
**Problem**: State what without principles/trade-offs
**Solution**: Always explain reasoning, not just decision

## AI Integration Notes

### Context Signals That Should Trigger This SOP
- Teams describing "lack of alignment" or "people going different directions"
- Meetings that end without clear next steps
- Resources not matching stated priorities
- Alpha-type teammates arguing about who's right
- Paralysis from uncertainty
- Post-mortems where no one remembers what was actually decided
- Hedge-betting behavior (teams pursuing multiple approaches simultaneously)

### How to Adapt for Different Situations

**For Small Teams (3-10 people)**:
- Less formal documentation needed
- Can do verbal check-ins for clarity
- Faster iteration on decisions
- Still need explicit "here's what we're doing"

**For Large Organizations (100+)**:
- Need written clarity statements
- Formalize in product reviews
- Include in OKR process
- Train managers to push for clarity

**For Different Cultures**:
- Direct cultures (Israeli, Dutch): More natural
- Indirect cultures (many Asian, US): Need to teach "disagreeing vs. misunderstanding" distinction
- Hierarchical: May need executive modeling

**For Different Decisions Types**:
- Tactical: Verbal clarity sufficient
- Strategic: Written clarity required
- Reversible: Lower bar for clarity
- Irreversible: Higher bar for clarity

### Limitations and Edge Cases
- Some decisions genuinely need more data (don't force premature clarity)
- Creative processes may need more ambiguity initially
- Research phases should stay open longer
- Not applicable to discovery work (that's about creating confusion productively)
- May conflict with consensus-heavy cultures (need adaptation)

### Signs of Success
- Meetings end with clear decisions and next steps
- Resources flow to stated priorities
- Teams can articulate trade-offs they're making
- Post-mortems identify clear lessons
- New team members quickly understand direction
- Less time spent in escalations and debates

### Warning Signs
- People saying "might be wrong but not confused" but can't articulate the decision
- Using phrase to shut down debate
- Decisions stated but resources elsewhere
- Constant reopening of settled questions
- Phrase becomes joke/meme without substance
