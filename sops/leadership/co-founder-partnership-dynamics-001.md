## Overview
Principles for building and maintaining effective co-founder relationships through high-pressure moments, based on Mike Krieger's partnership with Kevin Systrom at Instagram. Focuses on in-person connection during crises, complementary skill sets, and shared values over time.

## When to Use
- Evaluating potential co-founder relationships
- Navigating difficult moments as co-founders (near-death experiences, pivots, conflicts)
- Feeling misalignment or distance from co-founder
- Scaling from 2 founders to larger team
- Making critical company decisions that affect partnership dynamics

## Prerequisites
- Active co-founder relationship (or evaluating one)
- Shared commitment to company success
- Willingness to have difficult conversations
- Physical ability to meet in person when needed

## Procedure

### Step 1: Build the Relationship Foundation Early
Long-term co-founder relationships often have roots before the company exists.

**Mike's Background:**
- Built first iPhone apps together in 2007 with Joel Lewenstein (later recruited him to Anthropic)
- Both at Stanford together
- Stayed in touch over years before working together again
- Already knew each other's working styles and values

**What Matters in Early Relationship:**
- Complementary skills (not duplicative)
- Shared values around ethics, users, quality
- Compatible working styles and communication
- Mutual respect for different strengths

**Action**:
- Before co-founding: Work on small project together first (side project, hackathon)
- If already co-founders: Document explicitly what each brings (avoid overlap/resentment)
- List 3 areas where your co-founder is better than you → lean on them there

### Step 2: Prioritize In-Person Connection During Crises
The most critical moments require physical presence, not Zoom calls.

**Mike's Instagram Memory:**
"Nothing replaces the Instagram days of we went through some hard times—Ben Horowitz calls them the 'we're f***ed, it's over' moments. This is definitely type 2 fun. I wouldn't say they were my favorite memories because they weren't happy ones, but memories that really stayed with me: me and Kevin at Taqueria Cancun on Market Street eating burritos at literally 11 PM being like, 'How are we going to get out of this? How are we going to work through this?'"

**Why In-Person Matters:**
- Difficult conversations happen more honestly face-to-face
- Body language and emotional connection matter
- Shared physical space creates shared stake
- Informal settings (late-night burritos) lower defensiveness
- Problems feel more manageable when facing them together

**Contrast with Remote:**
"Zoom is not a good replica for that. You tend to let things go or things build up over time."

**Action**:
- **Crisis Protocol**: If facing existential issue, schedule in-person meeting within 48 hours
- **Regular Cadence**: Meet in person monthly minimum, weekly if possible
- **Informal Settings**: Don't only meet in conference rooms—walks, meals, coffee
- **Unstructured Time**: Schedule "working sessions" that are just both present, working

### Step 3: Navigate Difficult Decisions Together (Case Study: Artifact Shutdown)
Major company decisions (pivots, shutdowns, fundraising) test co-founder alignment.

**Artifact Shutdown Process:**
Mike and Kevin faced decision to shut down Artifact news app after 1-2 years.

**Decision Factors They Evaluated:**
1. **Energy in the system**: "10 units of input for 1 unit of output"
2. **Opportunity cost**: AI changing landscape, better opportunities elsewhere
3. **Honest assessment**: "Is this the maximal way we're going to impact this?"
4. **Timeline**: "Do we expend another year or two only to find this is the case?"

**How They Decided:**
- "It was a conversation that went on for a couple of months"
- Not rushed, but also not indefinitely delayed
- Both needed to reach peace with decision
- Considered team, users, investors, but prioritized honest assessment

**Action for Hard Decisions:**
- Set decision deadline: "We'll decide by [date]"
- Each co-founder independently writes down position
- Meet in person to discuss (not over Slack/email)
- Identify: What data would change our minds?
- If still split after discussion: Defer to whoever has domain expertise (or take more time)

### Step 4: Maintain Shared Values as Company Scales
Co-founder alignment on values matters more than alignment on tactics.

**Artifact Values Example (Ethics Over Growth):**

**The Ethical Lines They Wouldn't Cross:**
- Could have used aggressive ad-blocking for better UX → chose not to ("doesn't feel like playing fair with publishers")
- Could have wrapped links in artifact.news for attribution → felt "contrived"
- Could have added forced sharing mechanics → "lines we didn't want to cross that felt ethically not us"

**Mike's Reflection**:
"Maybe if we had done that it would've grown more, but I don't think that's the company we wanted to have built. I don't think we were the founders to have built it that way."

**Shared Values at Instagram (Implied):**
- Product quality and simplicity
- User experience over short-term metrics
- Scrappiness and hustle (late nights, whatever it takes)

**Action**:
- Annual "values check": Do we still agree on what we won't compromise?
- When considering growth tactic: "Is this something we'd be proud of?"
- Explicitly discuss: "What would make us feel we'd sold out?"
- Write down 3-5 "lines we won't cross" and revisit yearly

### Step 5: Develop Complementary Responsibilities
Co-founders need clear domains to avoid stepping on toes.

**Mike's Evolution:**
- Instagram: Co-founder (product/engineering focus implied)
- Artifact: Co-founder with Kevin Systrom (similar domains to Instagram)
- Anthropic: CPO (clear product domain, not overlapping with CEO Dario)

**Warning Sign (Artifact):**
- Both founders from product/design background
- Potentially overlapping domains
- Distributed setup made role clarity harder

**Action**:
- Every quarter, update: "These decisions are yours, these are mine, these are shared"
- Shared decisions should be <20% of total
- If constantly debating the same territory → need to reassign ownership
- Complement each other's weaknesses, don't duplicate strengths

### Step 6: Know When Partnership Has Run Its Course
Co-founder relationships can evolve, end, or transform over time.

**Mike's Trajectory:**
- Instagram (with Kevin): Ran successfully, acquired by Facebook, both stayed for years
- Artifact (with Kevin): Shut down together, moved on to new things
- Anthropic: No co-founder relationship; joined as CPO under founder-CEO

**Signs Partnership Might Need Evolution:**
- Different visions for next chapter
- One wants to start fresh, other wants to continue
- Personal life changes making partnership harder
- Lost trust or respect (rare but critical if it happens)

**Healthy Evolution Examples:**
- Both move on to separate next ventures (Artifact → Mike to Anthropic)
- One stays as CEO, other transitions to board/advisor
- Both recognize they want different things and part amicably

**Action**:
- Annual: "Do we both still want to be doing this together?"
- If answer is anything but enthusiastic yes → deeper conversation needed
- Have lawyer/mediator on standby for equity/transition discussions (hope you don't need them)
- Ending partnership ≠ ending friendship (but requires intentional maintenance)

### Step 7: Leverage the Crisis-Forged Bond
Relationships that survive near-death experiences are incredibly strong.

**Mike's Instagram Reflection:**
"Type 2 fun" = hard in the moment, meaningful in retrospect
"We're f***ed, it's over moments" → when you figure it out together, bond is unbreakable

**Leverage This for Later:**
- "Remember when we thought [X crisis] would kill us?" → puts new problems in perspective
- Shared history is shorthand for trust
- Can skip the "do you have my back?" question → you already know

**For New Co-Founders Without Crisis Experience:**
- First hard moment is hardest (haven't proven you'll stick together yet)
- How you handle first crisis sets precedent for all future ones
- After first successful crisis navigation, reference it: "We got through X, we'll get through this"

**Action**:
- After surviving a crisis together: Explicitly acknowledge it
- "That was really hard. I'm grateful we figured it out together."
- Document what worked in crisis mode (you'll need it again)
- Build ritual to commemorate (annual dinner at the burrito place, inside joke)

## Expected Outcomes
- Stronger co-founder relationship through intentional practice
- Clear division of responsibilities reducing conflict
- Effective crisis navigation when existential moments arise
- Shared values maintained even as company scales
- Ability to make hard decisions (pivots, shutdowns) together
- Long-term partnership OR healthy transition when time comes

## Common Pitfalls

### Pitfall 1: Relying on Remote Communication for Hard Conversations
**Mistake**: Trying to resolve major conflicts or make existential decisions over Slack/Zoom

**Why It Fails**: "You tend to let things go or things build up over time"

**Solution**: Book flight, meet in person, stay until resolved.

### Pitfall 2: Duplicating Each Other's Strengths
**Mistake**: Two co-founders both wanting to be "the product person" or "the tech person"

**Why It Fails**: Constant overlap, decision gridlock, unclear accountability

**Solution**: Find distinct domains. If both strong in same area, one focuses on it while other develops new strength.

### Pitfall 3: Avoiding the Hard Conversation Too Long
**Mistake**: Knowing Artifact (or any product) isn't working, but putting off the conversation for 6+ months

**Why It Fails**: Opportunity cost grows, team morale suffers, resentment builds

**Solution**: Set decision forcing-functions. "We'll evaluate seriously on [date]." Then actually do it.

### Pitfall 4: Letting Ego Drive Decisions
**Mistake (Mike avoided this)**: Not wanting to shut down Artifact because "What will people think after Instagram?"

**Why It Works to Avoid**: "I was really at peace with the decision"

**Solution**: Make decision based on data and opportunity cost, not external perception. You'll be respected for honesty.

### Pitfall 5: Only Connecting in Meetings
**Mistake**: Only seeing co-founder in scheduled 1:1s or board meetings

**Why It Fails**: Relationship becomes transactional, lose emotional connection

**Solution**: Late-night burritos. Walks. Working sessions. Unstructured time.

## AI Integration Notes

### Context Signals for This SOP
- User mentions "co-founder conflict" or "co-founder relationship"
- Questions about "how to work with co-founder"
- Discussions of startup crises or near-death experiences
- Mentions of shutting down a company or pivoting
- Questions like "should we keep working together?"

### Adaptation Guidance
- **For solo founders**: Many principles apply to early key hires (treat first engineer/designer like co-founder)
- **For 3+ co-founders**: Need more explicit role clarity and decision-making processes
- **For remote-first companies**: In-person time even MORE critical given it's rarer
- **For non-startup contexts**: Applies to any high-stakes partnership (law partners, agency co-founders, etc.)

### Key Quotes to Reference
- "Me and Kevin at Taqueria Cancun eating burritos at 11 PM being like, 'How are we going to get out of this?'"
- "Zoom is not a good replica for that. You tend to let things go or things build up over time."
- "I don't think that's the company we wanted to have built. I don't think we were the founders to have built it that way."
- "Type 2 fun. I wouldn't say my favorite memories because they weren't happy ones, but memories that really stayed with me."

### Limitations
- Based primarily on 2-person co-founder experiences
- Tech startup context (may differ in other industries)
- Both Mike's major co-founder experiences were with same person (Kevin Systrom)
- Assumes co-founders are roughly equal in equity/power
- Less applicable to founder-employee relationships (different power dynamics)

### When NOT to Apply
- If co-founder relationship involves abuse, harassment, or illegal behavior → seek legal counsel immediately
- If trust is completely broken → may need mediator/lawyer rather than in-person conversation
- If physical safety is a concern → remote communication appropriate
