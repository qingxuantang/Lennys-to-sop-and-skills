## Overview
Great basketball coaches are measured not just by their championships, but by their "coaching tree" — the assistants who went on to become successful head coaches. The same principle applies to product and tech leadership: **your legacy isn't just what you shipped, but who you developed and where they went**. The key insight: **think of product management as a team sport where your job is to coach people up to greatness**.

## When to Use
- Building a leadership philosophy
- Developing team members
- Measuring your impact as a leader
- Creating sustainable teams
- Building organizational capability

## Prerequisites
- Management or leadership role
- Team members to develop
- Long-term perspective
- Commitment to others' growth

## Core Concept: The Coaching Tree

### What is a Coaching Tree?
In basketball, a coaching tree is the lineage of coaches who learned under a head coach and went on to success.

**Examples:**
- Mike Krzyzewski's assistants became Division I head coaches
- John Calipari's tree spans college and pro basketball
- Success measured by who you develop, not just your wins

### Application to Product/Tech Leadership

**Your coaching tree includes:**
- Direct reports who became leaders elsewhere
- PMs who grew into senior roles
- Engineers who became managers
- People who say you changed their career

**Measuring your tree:**
> "I have people who I've worked with who are running growth at Stripe or the CPO at Chief or now running stories at Instagram that were on my team in the earlier days. And their success is my success."

### PM as Team Sport (Not CEO)

**Common framing:** "PM is like being CEO of the product"

**Better framing:** "PM is a team sport"

**What this means:**
- You're the coach, not the star player
- Success comes from team performance
- Not everyone needs to be LeBron
- Role players matter and should feel valued

> "Not everyone's going to be a star player. But not everyone needs to be a LeBron James or Kobe Bryant. You need role players. You need really strong role players."

## Procedure

### Step 1: Adopt the Coaching Mindset
Shift from individual contributor to developer of people.

**Mindset shifts:**
| From | To |
|------|-----|
| "I need to have the answers" | "I need to help them find answers" |
| "I do the important work" | "I enable important work" |
| "My success is what I ship" | "My success is who I develop" |
| "I lead by directing" | "I lead by coaching" |

**Key question to ask yourself:**
"If I left tomorrow, would my team be better because of me?"

### Step 2: Know Your Team by Name and Story
Invest in understanding each person deeply.

**What "name and story" means:**
- Their professional background and aspirations
- Their personal life and what matters to them
- Their strengths and growth areas
- Their motivations and fears

**How to build this knowledge:**
- Regular 1:1s focused on them, not just work
- Remember details and follow up
- Understand their goals beyond current role
- Learn about their life outside work

**Example:**
> "I still keep in touch with students from 20 years ago. That's the comment I made about knowing people by name and story."

### Step 3: Identify Role Players
Not everyone needs to be a superstar.

**Types of valuable contributors:**
| Role | Value |
|------|-------|
| Star player | High-impact, high-visibility work |
| Reliable executor | Consistent, dependable delivery |
| Culture carrier | Maintains team norms and values |
| Domain expert | Deep knowledge in specific area |
| Connector | Builds relationships across teams |

**Key principle:**
- Celebrate all roles, not just star players
- Help people find their fit
- A great role player is more valuable than a mediocre star
- Team success > individual glory

### Step 4: Coach Up, Not Out
When someone struggles, develop them.

**Coaching approach:**
1. Diagnose where they're stuck (use Bloom's Taxonomy)
2. Provide targeted development
3. Give stretch opportunities with support
4. Celebrate progress
5. Patience — growth takes time

**When coaching isn't working:**
- If after sustained effort someone isn't growing
- Role might not be right fit
- Help them find better fit (internal or external)
- Don't keep them in wrong seat too long

### Step 5: Delegate for Growth
Give opportunities that stretch people.

**Delegation framework:**
| Task Type | Who Gets It |
|-----------|-------------|
| Within capability | Anyone who needs practice |
| Stretch (+10-20%) | High-potential, needs growth |
| Way beyond | Break down or pair with senior person |

**Principles:**
- Delegation is a gift of growth, not dumping work
- Provide support proportional to stretch
- Expect mistakes, use them for learning
- Celebrate taking on challenge, not just success

### Step 6: Track Your Coaching Tree
Maintain relationships after people move on.

**Tracking methods:**
- Stay connected on LinkedIn
- Periodic check-ins (coffee, calls)
- Celebrate their wins publicly
- Be a reference when asked
- Offer help when you can

**What to track:**
- Where did your former team members go?
- What did they accomplish?
- How do they describe their time with you?
- Would they work with you again?

### Step 7: Build for Sustainability
Create teams that outlast you.

**Sustainable team practices:**
- Document knowledge and processes
- Cross-train team members
- Develop multiple potential successors
- Create culture, not just deliverables
- Build systems, not dependencies on you

**Test:**
If you left for 3 months, would the team:
- Continue functioning?
- Maintain quality?
- Still grow and develop?
- Keep the culture?

## Expected Outcomes
- Stronger, more capable team members
- Better team performance over time
- Legacy of developed leaders
- Sustainable teams
- Reputation as leader worth following

## Common Pitfalls

### Being the hero
- Taking on all hard work yourself
- Not giving stretch opportunities
- Team doesn't grow
- Unsustainable for you

### Only developing stars
- Neglecting role players
- Stars leave, team falls apart
- Missing hidden potential
- Team morale suffers

### Not staying connected
- People leave, relationship ends
- Miss seeing your impact
- No reference network
- Lose touch with industry

### Expecting instant results
- People grow slowly
- Frustration at lack of progress
- Give up too early
- Missing the long game

### Measuring only your direct output
- "I shipped X features"
- Ignoring team development
- Short-term thinking
- Missing leadership opportunity

## AI Integration Notes

### Context signals that should trigger this SOP:
- "How do I develop my team?"
- "What's my leadership legacy?"
- "How do I measure success as a leader?"
- Team development questions

### How to apply:
- Introduce coaching tree concept
- Help identify team roles
- Design development approach
- Create sustainability practices

### Key insight:
Your legacy as a leader isn't measured in features shipped or revenue generated. It's measured in people developed. Who went on to great things because you invested in them? Who would say you changed their career? That's your coaching tree, and it matters more than any product metric.
