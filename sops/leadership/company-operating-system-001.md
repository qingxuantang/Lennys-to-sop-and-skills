# Company Operating System Framework

## Metadata
- **Source**: Claire Hughes Johnson - Lenny's Podcast
- **Domain**: Leadership / Operations
- **Type**: Framework SOP
- **Applicable To**: Founders, COOs, Executives, Managers
- **Company Stage**: Post-PMF through Scale-up (0.5 to 2.0)
- **Difficulty**: Intermediate to Advanced

## Overview
A Company Operating System is the set of structures, processes, and cadences that enable a company to scale effectively. Think of it like building a house: you need **foundation** (founding documents), **supporting beams** (how you plan and review), and **mechanicals** (operational cadence). The key insight: **if you do these things well, they become stabilizing forces during chaos** rather than bureaucratic overhead.

## When to Use
- Scaling past product-market fit
- People asking "how do we do things here?"
- New hires need too much context
- Decisions are slowing down
- Teams are misaligned
- You're growing faster than your processes

## Prerequisites
- Product-market fit (or close to it)
- Leadership alignment on direction
- Willingness to document and systematize
- Some operational maturity

## Core Concept: The House Metaphor

### Foundation: Founding Documents
The bedrock documents that answer "why do we exist?" and "how do we work?"

### Supporting Beams: Planning & Review Structures
The mechanisms for setting goals, reviewing progress, and making decisions.

### Mechanicals: Operating Cadence
The rhythm of how you work — meetings, reviews, planning cycles.

## Component 1: Founding Documents

### Mission
**What it is**: One line describing what you're trying to accomplish.

**Stripe example**: "Increase the GDP of the internet."

**Test**: Can everyone in the company recite it?

### Long-Term Goals
**What it is**: More detailed articulation of why you exist (beyond the one-liner).

**Stripe example**: "Advance the state of the art in developer tools."

**Characteristics:**
- Should last 3-5+ years
- Not numerical targets
- Explain the "why" behind the mission
- Help people understand investment decisions

### Operating Principles / Values
**What it is**: The behaviors and beliefs that define how you work.

**Purpose:**
- Help candidates self-select
- Guide decision-making
- Create shared vocabulary
- Enable decentralized decisions

**Key insight**: These should be specific enough that candidates can evaluate "do I want to work here?"

## Component 2: Supporting Structures

### Goal-Setting System (OKRs or equivalent)
**Purpose**: Align the company on what matters now.

**Requirements:**
- Common structure across teams
- Replicable from company to individual
- Regular review cadence

**OKR approach:**
- Company-level OKRs cascade down
- Teams set supporting OKRs
- Individuals can see how they connect

### Quarterly Business Reviews (QBRs)
**Purpose**: Review progress and course-correct.

**Components:**
- Strategy review
- Metrics review
- What's working / what's not

**Cadence pitfalls:**
- Too infrequent: Content is stale ("we already discussed this")
- Too frequent: Not enough progress to review

**Netflix approach**: "Metrics review and strategy review were too infrequent for new products, so we made them every six weeks instead of quarterly."

### Planning Process
**Purpose**: Decide what to build and how to allocate resources.

**Claire's advice:**
- Don't seek perfection — pick something and commit
- Revise annually, not constantly
- Don't throw out new processes too quickly

> "Do very few things consistently and try to do them well, then see if they're working for you, and then once a year, maybe think about a revision."

### Decision-Making Framework
**Purpose**: Clarify who decides and how.

**Options:**
- RACI/DACI
- SPADE (Gokul's framework)
- DRI model

**Claire's advice:**
> "If you're not sure who the decision maker is, one, it's probably you. And I'd rather you act that way than not because you're going to slow the whole company down."

## Component 3: Operating Cadence

### What Cadence Provides
- Predictability
- Stability during chaos
- Forcing functions for progress

**Claire's insight:**
> "Where stability comes from is in ritual and in common practices that you share. Quarterly goals or monthly goals — that's a ritual, that's a thing we do, and it's actually a source of stability."

### Elements of Cadence
**Regular meetings:**
- All-hands (company updates)
- Team syncs
- One-on-ones
- Leadership team meetings

**Review cycles:**
- Weekly metrics reviews
- Monthly/quarterly business reviews
- Annual planning

**Events:**
- Customer events (external deadlines that drive internal urgency)
- Internal demos
- Offsites

### Signs Your Cadence is Off

**Too fast (reduce frequency):**
- Not enough progress between reviews
- Reviews feel redundant
- People are in meetings, not working

**Too slow (increase frequency):**
- Content is stale when reviewed
- "We already had this meeting"
- Strategy discussions hijack metrics reviews

### Cadence Anti-Patterns

**Creating overhead:**
> "Be very wary of actually slowing velocity down by creating overhead. One thing we try to do at Stripe is if we're looking at metrics, let's just look at your dashboard live."

**Presentation theater:**
- Don't require special prep for metrics reviews
- Use live dashboards
- "Spin the wheel" on who presents

## Procedure: Building Your Operating System

### Step 1: Start with Founding Documents
If people ask "what's important here?", you need founding documents.

**Minimum set:**
1. Mission (one line)
2. Long-term goals (why you exist)
3. Operating principles (how you work)

**Use existing content:**
> "A lot of the story you tell to investors, early ones especially, is the story you should be telling internally."

### Step 2: Establish Goal Structure
Pick a system (OKRs, etc.) and commit.

**Requirements:**
- Common format across teams
- Clear connection from company to individual
- Regular check-in cadence

### Step 3: Create Review Mechanisms
Set up recurring reviews.

**Start simple:**
- Weekly: Team syncs, metrics check
- Monthly: Deeper metrics review
- Quarterly: Strategy + business review

**Iterate on frequency** based on whether content is fresh or stale.

### Step 4: Document and Communicate
Make it accessible.

**Communication strategy:**
- Multiple channels (email, video, all-hands)
- Repetition ("leaders are repeaters-in-chief")
- Intranet/wiki for reference

> "Never think that one communication reaches the audience. You have to be smart about how you communicate."

### Step 5: Scale Through Culture
Let the operating system propagate through the organization.

**Claire's insight:**
> "When a leader treats their team with real care, their direct reports treat their teams with real care. Relationships don't scale, but culture does scale."

## Expected Outcomes
- Faster decision-making
- Better alignment
- Reduced chaos and confusion
- More scalable organization
- New hires productive faster

## Common Pitfalls

### Perfection-seeking
> "Don't let the perfect be the enemy of the good. There is no perfect org structure, there's no perfect operating approach."

### Constant process changes
- Creates chaos
- People can't learn the system
- "Some companies throw out new things every few months"

### Skipping the foundations
- Building structures without documents
- No shared understanding of mission/values
- Leads to misalignment later

### Over-engineering early
- Too much process too soon
- Slows down small teams
- Wait until you feel the pain

## Implementation Checklist

**Quarter 1 (if scaling):**
- [ ] Document mission and long-term goals
- [ ] Draft operating principles
- [ ] Establish goal-setting system
- [ ] Set up basic review cadence

**Quarter 2:**
- [ ] Refine based on feedback
- [ ] Train new managers on systems
- [ ] Establish decision-making norms
- [ ] Create communication channels

**Ongoing:**
- [ ] Annual review and revision
- [ ] Onboard new hires to the system
- [ ] Iterate on cadence based on feedback

## AI Integration Notes

### Context signals that should trigger this SOP:
- User mentions "scaling," "growing pains"
- Questions about company structure
- "How do we work here?"
- Alignment and decision-making issues

### How to apply:
- Start with founding documents
- Build incrementally (don't over-engineer)
- Emphasize cadence as stabilizing force
- Connect to culture scaling

### Key insight:
The operating system should feel like stability during chaos, not bureaucracy. If it's slowing you down, simplify.
