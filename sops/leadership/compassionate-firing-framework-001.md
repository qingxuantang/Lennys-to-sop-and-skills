- **Type**: Process
- **Applicable To**: Managers, Directors, VPs, CEOs
- **Difficulty**: Advanced

## Overview
A systematic approach to letting people go that separates the decision (what's right for customers/company) from implementation (minimizing harm to all stakeholders). When executed properly, you remain friends with people you fire and they appreciate your help finding their ideal next role.

## When to Use
- Individual performance doesn't meet expectations
- Role elimination due to reorganization
- Skills mismatch between person and evolving role needs
- Company-wide layoffs requiring headcount reduction
- Discovering you don't know "where the bar is" for letting people go
- Any situation requiring someone to leave the organization

## Prerequisites
- Clear performance expectations previously communicated
- Decision-making authority (or alignment with decision maker)
- Understanding of Wei Deng framework: Separate Decision from Implementation
- Time commitment to actively help person transition (1-2 hours minimum)
- Emotional readiness to have difficult conversation with compassion

## Procedure

### Step 1: Make the Decision (Separate from People Impact)

**Framework: Who are you solving for?**
1. Identify the primary stakeholder: Almost always the **customer**
2. Ask: "What would the customer want?"
   - Answer: Only the best employees serving them
   - Anyone not great should not be there
3. Make the decision based purely on this customer-first lens

**Testing if you know "where the bar is":**
- Question: "Have you ever let someone go and regretted it?"
- If answer is "No" → You don't know where the bar is
- The bar of where you should let people go is here: [high]
- The bar where you've been letting people go is here: [much lower]
- Until you get close to the line (and occasionally cross it with regret), you don't know where it is

**Matt's personal test:**
- Realized he'd never regretted a firing
- Looked at team of only outperformers (already did Netflix-style talent density)
- Identified someone who was outperforming but not critical anymore
- Let them go to find "the bar"
- After 2-3 months: confirmed it was right decision; company operated better with fewer people

**Key insight**: "With fewer people in the organization, things work better... every additional human causes extra overhead and geometrically so."

### Step 2: Plan the Implementation (Who Gets Hurt and How to Help)

**Identify all stakeholders who experience pain:**

1. **The employee being let go**
   - What they really want: Great job where they're needed and fulfilled
   - Currently: Not critical to this company (you're holding them back)
   - How to help: Become their agent to find ideal next role

2. **You (the manager)**
   - What you really want: Not have difficult conversation
   - How to help yourself: Cognitive behavioral therapy - do it and realize it's not that bad
   - Build competency through practice

3. **The remaining team**
   - What they really want: Know their friend is okay and release their sadness
   - How to help: Listen to their emotions, let them express and feel heard
   - Provide transparency about decision and future

### Step 3: Prepare for the Conversation

**Logistics:**
1. Schedule 15-30 minute one-on-one (don't indicate it's unusual)
2. Can be remote or in-person (no difference in effectiveness)
3. Prepare yourself emotionally to sit with their pain
4. Have follow-up time available (schedule 1-hour agent session)
5. Clear your next hour in case they need extended time

**Mental preparation:**
- Remember: You're helping them find where they're truly needed
- This is one of three most traumatic life events (alongside losing spouse, losing home)
- Their brain will shut down; expect strong emotions
- Your job is to sit with them through it, not run from it

### Step 4: Deliver the Message (Three-Part Structure)

**Part 1: The Warning (Prevent Amygdala Hijack)**
```
"Hey [name], this is going to be a difficult conversation.
I want you to take a few seconds and prepare yourself.
You are not going to enjoy this.
[Pause - give them 5-10 seconds]
Are you ready?"
```

**Why this works**: Amygdala gets triggered by surprise. Advance warning allows mental preparation and reduces extreme fear/anger response.

**Part 2: The Message**
```
"I'm letting you go. Here's why: [specific reason]"
```

- Be direct and clear
- Keep reason brief and factual
- Don't over-explain or justify
- Don't apologize excessively (undermines decision)

**Part 3: Open Space for Emotions**
```
"My guess is you're feeling a lot of anger right now, fear, sadness.
Is that true?
And if so, would you be willing to share with me what you're feeling and what you're thinking?"
```

- Sometimes they don't answer - that's okay
- Often they do share - let them
- This is critical: allows them to release emotions
- You're not running from their pain; you're sitting with them through it

### Step 5: Make Them Feel Heard (Active Listening)

**Reflect back what you hear:**
1. Listen completely without interrupting
2. Reflect their words: "I think what I heard you say is... Is that right?"
3. If they say "not quite," reflect again until they confirm
4. For deeper connection, reflect the thoughts you imagine in their head:
   - "I think you're thinking 'Screw you, Matt. How dare you...'"
   - They'll either confirm or say "That's stronger than I was thinking, but directionally right"
   - (Which really means yes)

**Why this matters**: Shows you're not running from their pain. You're present with them through the difficulty.

### Step 6: Become Their Agent (Critical Differentiator)

**Not passive support - active agency:**

❌ **Passive** (Don't do this):
- "If you need a reference, I'm happy to provide one"
- "Let me know if I can help"
- "I'm here if you need anything"

✅ **Active** (Do this):
```
"I want to actively help you find your dream job.
Let's schedule another hour [tomorrow/this week] where I become your agent.
I'm going to help you discover what your ideal role is,
and I'm going to help you create it or land it."
```

**What being an agent means:**
1. Discover what they're passionate about (this is what they're good at)
2. Help them articulate their ideal next role
3. Actively reach out to people in your network
4. Make warm introductions
5. Advocate for them genuinely

**Time investment**: 1-2 hours of your time
- Initial conversation: 1 hour to understand their ideal role
- Outreach: 15-30 minutes making 5-10 targeted introductions
- Follow-up: 15-30 minutes checking in

**The response**: When you reach out to your network saying "I have this great person," people pay attention and respond.

**What if they're a bad performer?**
- Everyone is good at something
- Find out what they're passionate about
- That's what you recommend them for
- You can genuinely advocate for them in their area of passion/strength

**What if they refuse help?**
- Some will say "Screw you, I don't want your help"
- That's okay - they still recognize you offered
- You've done your part

**The litmus test**: "Everybody I've let go, I believe anyway, that I continue to be friends with. That shows me that the process by which I let people go is a humane one."

### Step 7: Handling Emotional Response

**If they shut down (no response):**
- Don't force it
- Reiterate you want to help
- Give them space to process
- Follow up next day to schedule agent session

**If they get angry:**
- Don't get defensive
- Let them express it fully
- Reflect it back: "I hear that you're angry and feeling..."
- Remember: anger is a cover for pain
- Your job is to absorb it without pushing back

**If they get sad/cry:**
- Sit with them
- Don't try to fix it or minimize it
- Let them feel it
- Silence is okay
- Reflect: "This is really painful for you"

**If they ask "Why not someone else?":**
- Don't compare to others
- Return to the factual reason about their role
- "This is about what the company needs going forward"

## Expected Outcomes

**Immediate (Day 1):**
- Difficult conversation completed
- Person has expressed emotions and feels heard
- Relationship preserved (not destroyed)
- Agent session scheduled

**Short-term (2-4 weeks):**
- Person has clarity on ideal next role
- You've made 5-10 warm introductions
- Person is interviewing or starting new role
- They appreciate your help

**Long-term:**
- You remain friends with person
- Your reputation as compassionate leader grows
- You've learned where "the bar" is
- You're more confident in future firings
- Person is thriving in better-fit role

## Common Pitfalls

**Pitfall 1: Over-explaining or justifying the decision**
- **Mistake**: Going on and on about why you made the decision
- **Fix**: Brief, factual reason then move to emotions and support
- **Why**: Over-explaining suggests you're not confident in the decision

**Pitfall 2: Trying to make them feel better immediately**
- **Mistake**: "It's going to be okay, you'll find something better"
- **Fix**: Let them feel the pain; don't minimize it
- **Why**: They need to process the loss before moving forward

**Pitfall 3: Not actually being an agent (just offering to be one)**
- **Mistake**: "Let me know if you want help finding your next role"
- **Fix**: Schedule the session immediately, be proactive in outreach
- **Impact**: This is what separates compassionate from typical firing

**Pitfall 4: Firing someone who reports to someone else**
- **Mistake**: Skip-level firing without involving their direct manager
- **Fix**: Direct manager must deliver the news in one-on-one
- **Why**: Relationship matters; news must come from their manager

**Pitfall 5: Letting fear of conversation delay the decision**
- **Mistake**: Knowing someone should go but waiting weeks/months
- **Fix**: Remember fear gives bad advice; act within days of decision
- **Impact**: Delay hurts company AND person (keeps them from finding right fit)

**Pitfall 6: Not recommending them authentically**
- **Mistake**: Making introductions for roles they'll fail at
- **Fix**: Find what they're genuinely good at and passionate about
- **Why**: Your reputation matters; only recommend for actual strengths

**Pitfall 7: Comparing to other employees during conversation**
- **Mistake**: "We're keeping Jane because she's better at X"
- **Fix**: Keep focus on what company needs and what they want
- **Why**: Comparisons feel dehumanizing and create resentment

- Fear and Anger Framework (for managing your own emotions before firing)
- Talent Density Framework

## Variations for Special Contexts

### For Founders/Executives
- Same process applies
- Higher stakes means more important to get right
- Your network is more valuable for agent role

### For First-Time Managers
- Practice the conversation with your manager first
- Have your manager available for consultation during/after
- Start with lower-stakes situations to build confidence

### For Remote Teams
- Zoom/video call works equally well as in-person
- Same script and process
- Potentially schedule longer sessions (harder to read emotion remotely)

## AI Integration Notes

**Context signals that should trigger this SOP:**
- User describes needing to fire someone
- User expresses fear about letting someone go
- User asks "how do I fire someone?"
- User describes person not performing but feeling bad about it
- User mentions person's personal circumstances as reason not to fire
- Phrases: "they really need this job", "I don't want to hurt them", "they're a good person"

**How to adapt for different situations:**
- **Performance issue**: Ensure prior feedback was given; this shouldn't be a surprise
- **Layoff/elimination**: Emphasize it's not about their performance
- **Skills mismatch**: Frame as finding better fit for both sides
- **First-time firer**: Add extra preparation and practice steps
- **Senior executive**: Same process but agent role is more impactful

**Red flags to watch for:**
- User wants to fire via email/Slack (STOP - must be one-on-one)
- User hasn't made clear decision yet (go back to decision framework)
- User wants to skip agent role (challenge this - it's critical)
- User plans to avoid explaining why (must be clear and direct)

**Limitations and edge cases:**
- Serious misconduct (harassment, illegal activity) requires different approach + HR/legal
- Person with history of litigation requires legal consultation
- Some cultures have different norms around directness (adapt language, not structure)
- Truly toxic people may not respond to compassion (still offer, but protect yourself)
- Some companies have policies prohibiting agent role (advocate for changing policy)
