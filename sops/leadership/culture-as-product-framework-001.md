# Culture as Product Framework

## Metadata
- **Source**: Dharmesh Shah (HubSpot Co-founder & CTO) - Lenny's Podcast
- **Domain**: Leadership & Culture
- **Type**: Framework
- **Applicable To**: Founders, CEOs, Culture Leaders, Product Leaders at all company stages
- **Difficulty**: Intermediate to Advanced

## Overview
A paradigm-shifting framework that treats company culture as a product to be built, iterated, and improved for "customers" (employees). This approach transforms abstract cultural work into concrete product management practices with measurable outcomes, regular iteration, and customer feedback loops.

## When to Use
- You're building or scaling company culture
- Culture feels abstract and difficult to operationalize
- You need to justify investments in cultural initiatives
- Leadership wants to "preserve" culture (which is often the wrong approach)
- You're scaling rapidly and culture is degrading
- You want to make culture work systematic and measurable
- You need to handle "bugs" in your culture

## Prerequisites
- Basic understanding of product management principles
- Commitment to treating employees as customers of the culture
- Willingness to iterate on culture (not "preserve" it)
- Ability to conduct regular employee surveys
- Leadership buy-in for transparency and iteration
- Understanding that culture serves the business (enables great people to do great work)

## Procedure

### Step 1: Accept the Core Premise
Internalize that every company builds two products:
- Product 1: The product/service for customers
- Product 2: The culture/work environment for employees (the team)

If you accept this premise, everything else follows logically from product management best practices.

### Step 2: Identify Your Culture Product Customers
Define who the "customers" of your culture product are:
- Current employees (primary users)
- Potential employees (prospects)
- Alumni/former employees (churned users)
- Contractors and partners (adjacent users)

Just like a product, different customer segments may need different experiences.

### Step 3: Establish Culture Product Metrics
Define how you'll measure the "product" success:

**Primary Metric - Employee NPS**:
- "On a scale of 0-10, how likely are you to recommend [Company] as a place to work?"
- "Why did you give that answer?"
- Measure quarterly (same cadence as product metrics)
- Track trend over time, not just absolute score
- Segment by team, tenure, role, location

**Secondary Metrics**:
- Employee retention/churn rate
- Time-to-productivity for new hires
- Internal promotions vs. external hires
- Engagement scores
- Culture-related feedback volume and themes

### Step 4: Create Regular Feedback Loops
Implement systematic customer feedback mechanisms:

**Quarterly Surveys**:
- Conduct employee NPS survey every quarter without fail
- Make it anonymous for honest feedback
- Include open-ended questions for qualitative insights
- Publish all results transparently (raw data, no filtering)

**All-Hands/All-Minds Meetings**:
- Present survey results at next company-wide meeting
- Categorize feedback into themes
- Treat negative feedback as "bugs in the culture"
- Publicly commit to fixing specific issues
- Explain "works as designed" for items you won't change (with rationale)

### Step 5: Maintain a Culture Backlog
Manage culture improvements like a product backlog:
- List all "bugs" (problems identified in feedback)
- List all "feature requests" (suggestions from employees)
- Prioritize based on impact and feasibility
- Assign owners to specific culture improvements
- Set timelines and milestones
- Review progress in leadership meetings

### Step 6: Iterate, Don't Preserve
Reject the "preserve the culture" mindset:
- The needs of employees change as company scales
- What worked at 50 people may not work at 500
- Culture exists to help great people do great work - needs evolve
- Just like you'd never freeze product code, never freeze culture code

**Iteration Examples**:
- Adding titles after years without them (employee need changed)
- Evolving meeting policies as company grows
- Adjusting transparency policies while maintaining core value
- Updating benefits based on employee demographics

### Step 7: Define Core vs. Peripheral Culture Elements
Distinguish between what's core vs. what can evolve:

**Core Values (Federal Law)**:
- High-conviction principles you won't compromise
- Example: Transparency, autonomy, customer-first
- These are preserved even when difficult (e.g., transparency during IPO)
- Rare - should be 3-5 maximum

**Implementation Details (State Law)**:
- How core values manifest in practice
- Can vary by team/department based on needs
- Example: "Flexible hours" may not apply to customer support team
- These should iterate based on feedback

Use federal vs. state law metaphor:
- Federal = non-negotiable across company
- State = teams can optimize for their context within core principles

### Step 8: Implement Culture Release Cycles
Version and release culture updates:
- Major version updates: Annual comprehensive review
- Minor version updates: Quarterly adjustments based on feedback
- Patch updates: Ad-hoc fixes to critical bugs
- Publish release notes: "Here's what changed and why"
- Maintain changelog of culture evolution

### Step 9: Enable Team-Level Customization
Allow local optimization within core constraints:
- Teams can adapt cultural practices to their needs
- Example: Engineering team may need different collaboration patterns than sales
- Require teams to justify deviations from core (transparency)
- Share successful team-level innovations company-wide

### Step 10: Create Self-Fulfilling Aspirations
Use product roadmap thinking for aspirational culture:
- Include aspirational elements in Culture Code with clear labeling
- New employees ("new users") will assume aspirations are reality
- They'll behave according to stated culture (even if aspirational)
- Over time, aspirations become reality through new employee behavior
- Remove "aspirational" label once it's true

### Step 11: Build in Public (External Feedback)
Apply open-source product principles to culture:
- Publish Culture Code publicly (not just internally)
- Accept that "the internet is exceptionally good at telling you why you're an idiot"
- External feedback catches blind spots internal team misses
- Demonstrates authenticity and transparency to potential employees
- Creates accountability for walking the walk

### Step 12: Measure ROI of Culture Investments
Treat culture investments like product investments:
- Calculate cost of culture initiatives
- Measure impact on retention, productivity, hiring
- Compare to alternatives (higher compensation, etc.)
- Make data-informed decisions about culture investments
- Sunset culture programs that don't show ROI

## Expected Outcomes
- Culture becomes measurable with clear metrics (NPS, retention, etc.)
- Regular iteration prevents culture from becoming stale or misaligned
- Employee feedback is systematically collected and acted upon
- "Bugs" in culture are identified and fixed like product bugs
- Leadership has framework for deciding what to preserve vs. change
- Culture scales more effectively as company grows
- Reduced abstract discussions, more concrete action
- Culture becomes competitive advantage (like great product design)

## Common Pitfalls
- **Treating all culture as sacred/unchangeable**: Leads to ossification and misalignment with employee needs
  - *How to avoid*: Define core values (preserve) vs. implementation (iterate). Only 3-5 core values max.

- **Not actually iterating despite claiming to**: Publishing Culture Code and never updating it
  - *How to avoid*: Schedule quarterly reviews and annual major updates. Track version numbers.

- **Ignoring feedback or only cherry-picking**: Defeats the entire framework
  - *How to avoid*: Publish ALL feedback transparently. Respond to all major themes publicly.

- **Not distinguishing product customers from culture customers**: Optimizing for wrong audience
  - *How to avoid*: Always ask "does this help our people (employees) do great work?" not "does this impress customers?"

- **Skipping the metrics**: Culture without measurement is just hope
  - *How to avoid*: Employee NPS quarterly, non-negotiable. Publish results at all-hands.

- **Being defensive about "bugs"**: Treating culture feedback as personal criticism
  - *How to avoid*: Adopt product mindset - bugs are learning opportunities, not failures

- **Over-customization**: Every team has different culture = no unified culture
  - *How to avoid*: Clear core values everyone follows + local optimization within those constraints

## AI Integration Notes
When helping users apply culture-as-product framework, AI should:

**Emphasize the analogy**:
- Draw explicit parallels to product management practices they already know
- "How would you handle this if it were a product bug?"
- "What would your product backlog process suggest here?"

**Push for measurement**:
- Always ask "how will you measure this?"
- Suggest quarterly employee NPS as minimum viable metric
- Flag when decisions are being made without data

**Challenge preservation mindset**:
- When user says "preserve culture," ask "which parts specifically and why?"
- Distinguish core values from implementation details
- Suggest version control and iteration plans

**Structure feedback loops**:
- Recommend specific cadences (quarterly surveys, etc.)
- Help design all-hands presentation of results
- Suggest how to categorize and prioritize feedback

**Context signals that should trigger this SOP**:
- "How do we preserve our culture as we scale?"
- "Culture feels abstract and hard to work on"
- "We don't know if our culture initiatives are working"
- "Employees are complaining but we don't have a system to address it"
- "Our culture used to be great but it's degrading"

**How to adapt for different situations**:
- Early stage (< 50 people): Focus on Step 3-5, lighter process
- Growth stage (50-500): Full implementation, quarterly cadence critical
- Large scale (500+): Add team-level metrics, more sophisticated segmentation
- Distributed/remote: Additional async feedback mechanisms, virtual all-hands
- Crisis/rapid change: Increase feedback frequency to monthly temporarily

**Limitations and edge cases**:
- Very early stage (< 20 people): Framework may be overkill, focus on hiring for culture fit
- Toxic culture: Need intervention/reset before framework can work (framework assumes functional baseline)
- Leadership not bought in: Framework requires transparency and iteration commitment from top
- External constraints: Regulated industries may have limits on transparency
- Acquisition/merger: Conflicting cultures need different approach (culture integration SOP)
