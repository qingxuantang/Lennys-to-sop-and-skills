- **Type**: Process
- **Applicable To**: Founders, CEOs, Culture Leaders (3-4 years into company building, 50+ employees)
- **Difficulty**: Intermediate

## Overview
A systematic framework for articulating company culture by identifying the core attributes that predict employee success, rather than imposing theoretical values. This approach focuses on describing the existing culture that's working, making it measurable and actionable like a product specification.

## When to Use
- Your company is 3-4 years old and culture exists organically but isn't documented
- Leadership asks you to "go do culture" but you're not naturally a people person
- Employees are happy but can't articulate why beyond "the people are great"
- You need to scale hiring while maintaining cultural fit
- You want to make culture measurable and improvable over time

## Prerequisites
- Company has existed long enough to have an organic culture (typically 3+ years)
- Leadership commitment to transparency in the process
- Willingness to survey employees and publish responses
- Understanding that culture already exists - you're not creating it from scratch
- Acceptance that culture will be treated as an iterative product, not a fixed document

## Procedure

### Step 1: Reframe the Challenge
Ask yourself: "If I could write a Python function that would measure the probability of success of a new person coming into the company, what would the factors be?"
- Shift from "creating culture" to "articulating existing culture"
- Think systematically: what attributes predict success here?
- Focus on measurable characteristics, not vague aspirations
- Frame culture as the operating system of the company

### Step 2: Conduct Internal NPS Survey
Send an employee Net Promoter Score survey:
- Question 1: "On a scale of 0-10, how likely are you to recommend [Company] as a place to work?"
- Question 2: "Why did you give that answer?"
- Make survey anonymous but publish all responses (transparency principle)
- Prepare for potential negative reactions to "culture initiatives" (many companies do this poorly)

### Step 3: Analyze Survey Responses
Look beyond surface-level answers:
- If people say "because of the other people," dig deeper
- Ask: "What makes the people at [Company] the people that are at [Company]?"
- Identify specific attributes that define those people
- Look for patterns in what makes employees successful and happy
- Categorize responses into themes

### Step 4: Define Cultural Attributes
Create a list of 10-16 core attributes that answer the "success prediction" question:
- Focus on what actually exists, not what you wish existed
- Make each attribute specific and behavioral
- Test each attribute: "Does this predict success here?"
- Ensure attributes are measurable or observable
- Avoid corporate buzzwords that lack meaning

### Step 5: Create the Culture Code Deck
Document findings in a slide deck format:
- Start with exactly 16 slides (one per core attribute initially)
- Call it "Culture Code" because it's code that defines the cultural operating system
- Use clear, direct language (avoid corporate speak)
- Include specific examples and manifestations of each attribute
- Add "liner notes" for items that are aspirational but not yet true
- Mark aspirational items clearly: "This is not really true yet, it's more of an aspiration"

### Step 6: Gather Feedback and Iterate
Share draft with the team:
- Send to all employees for review
- Request brutal honesty: "Tell me where this isn't true"
- Be prepared for pushback on items that aren't reality yet
- Don't remove aspirational items - just label them clearly
- Iterate based on feedback while maintaining core intent

### Step 7: Publish and Make Transparent
Release the Culture Code:
- Share internally first, then externally
- Make it publicly accessible (embracing internet feedback)
- Accept that "the internet is exceptionally good at telling you why you're an idiot"
- Use external feedback to improve (learning in public)
- Update version number with each iteration

### Step 8: Establish Measurement System
Implement quarterly cultural health checks:
- Repeat NPS survey every quarter
- Track NPS score over time (this is the "culture product" metric)
- Categorize feedback into themes and "bugs"
- Publish all survey responses with transparency
- Create dashboard tracking cultural health metrics

### Step 9: Create Feedback Loop (All-Hands/All-Minds Meetings)
Present culture feedback at company-wide meetings:
- Share survey results transparently
- Identify "bugs in the culture" (just like product bugs)
- Commit to fixing specific issues: "Here's what we're going to do about this"
- Explain "works as designed" for items you won't change
- Set expectations: some feedback will be addressed, some won't be prioritized

### Step 10: Allow Aspirations to Become Reality
Let aspirational items evolve:
- Keep aspirational items in the deck with clear labels
- As new people join, they'll assume these aspirations are reality
- New employees will behave according to stated culture (even aspirational parts)
- Over time, aspirations become self-fulfilling prophecies
- Remove "aspirational" label once behavior matches statement

## Expected Outcomes
- Clear articulation of what makes people successful at your company
- Measurable culture that can be tracked via NPS and other metrics
- Hiring framework based on cultural attributes (not just skills)
- Self-reinforcing culture as aspirations become reality
- Foundation for scaling culture as company grows
- Reduced negative reaction to "culture work" because it's authentic
- Tool for onboarding that explains "how we operate here"

## Common Pitfalls
- **Imposing theoretical values vs. describing reality**: Don't create culture from scratch - articulate what exists. People can smell inauthenticity.
  - *How to avoid*: Start with "what predicts success here today?" not "what should our values be?"

- **Treating culture as static vs. iterative product**: Culture Code is version 1.0, not final version
  - *How to avoid*: Plan quarterly surveys and annual major revisions from day one

- **Hiding aspirational items vs. labeling them**: Being dishonest about gaps destroys trust
  - *How to avoid*: Use liner notes to clearly mark "not true yet, working toward this"

- **Over-indexing on negative feedback**: Some people will hate any formalized culture work
  - *How to avoid*: Acknowledge concerns, explain rationale, proceed with transparency

- **Making it abstract vs. actionable**: Culture should predict behavior, not just inspire posters
  - *How to avoid*: Use the "Python function" framework - what variables predict success?

- **Keeping it private vs. public**: Private culture codes can't benefit from external feedback
  - *How to avoid*: Publish externally once internally validated, embrace criticism

## AI Integration Notes
When helping users create culture codes, AI should:
- Emphasize description over prescription (what IS vs. what SHOULD BE)
- Push for specificity over buzzwords ("what does 'excellence' mean here specifically?")
- Suggest framing as prediction model: "what predicts success?"
- Recommend starting with employee NPS survey before drafting
- Flag aspirational statements and suggest labeling them as such
- Remind that culture codes should be versioned and iterated
- Suggest quarterly measurement cadence from the start
- Watch for signs of "imposing values" vs. "describing reality"

**Context signals that should trigger this SOP**:
- "How do we create our company culture?"
- "We need to document our values"
- "Employees can't articulate why they like working here"
- "How do we maintain culture as we scale?"
- "Our CEO asked me to work on culture"

**Limitations and edge cases**:
- Too early (< 2 years, < 20 people): Culture may not be stable enough to articulate
- Toxic existing culture: If survey reveals fundamental problems, need intervention SOP first
- Distributed/remote teams: May need additional mechanisms beyond all-hands meetings
- Rapid scaling: Culture may change faster than quarterly measurement can track
