## Metadata
- **Source**: Will Larson - Lenny's Podcast
- **Domain**: Leadership & Cross-Functional Collaboration
- **Type**: Framework
- **Applicable To**: Engineering Managers, Product Managers, Engineering Directors, Product Directors
- **Difficulty**: Intermediate
- **Company Stage**: All stages (especially important at scale)

## Overview
A framework for creating effective EM/PM partnerships through aligned incentives, deep understanding of each other's constraints, and shared accountability. The core innovation is treating EM/PM pairs as peers with the same performance rating, driving both parties to solve for the complete set of constraints rather than just their functional ones.

## When to Use
- When EM/PM pairs are consistently in conflict
- During performance review calibration for EMs and PMs
- When setting up team structures and accountability
- When product and engineering seem to have misaligned goals
- During team retrospectives or when resolving persistent friction
- When designing your organization's review and incentive structure

## Prerequisites
- Understanding that most conflicts stem from misaligned incentives or lack of understanding
- Willingness to hold EM/PM pairs jointly accountable
- Executive alignment between VPE/CTO and CPO/VP Product
- Clear articulation of what success means for product teams

## Procedure

### Step 1: Diagnose the Root Cause
Identify whether the issue is incentive misalignment or lack of understanding:

**Two Core Problems**:

**Problem 1: Misaligned Incentives**
- EM evaluated on: Technical excellence, interesting work for team, uptime/reliability
- PM evaluated on: Shipped features, user impact, revenue/metrics
- Result: Natural tension between stability and shipping

Examples:
- PM wants to say yes to sales requests (important for business)
- EM wants to say no (protects team and technical quality)
- PM pushes for fast launches
- EM pushes for addressing technical debt

**Problem 2: Lack of Understanding**
- EM and PM don't understand each other's true needs
- They argue positions before understanding underlying interests
- What they say they want ≠ what they actually need
- Quick to propose solutions before deeply understanding the problem

### Step 2: Implement Shared Performance Ratings
Create aligned incentives through shared accountability:

**Core Principle**: EM/PM pairs are peers and generally receive the same performance rating

**How It Works**:
- Chief Product Officer and CTO/VPE calibrate ratings together
- EM and PM for a given team/area evaluated together
- Both rated on the same outcomes: team delivery, impact, health
- Exceptions only for clear individual performance issues (obvious non-performance)

**Why This Works**:
- Forces both to care about complete set of constraints
- Eliminates finger-pointing ("PM is screwing up" or "EM won't deliver")
- Drives collaborative problem-solving
- Makes incentives transparent and shared

**Carta's Implementation**:
- Will Larson (CTO) and Vrushali (CPO) spend significant time calibrating together
- Teams know they're being evaluated together
- Creates powerful alignment on priorities

### Step 3: Extend to Broader Leadership (Trifecta Model)
Consider including business leadership in shared accountability:

**Trifecta Model**:
- EM + PM + Business Leader (GM, sales leader, etc.)
- All three get same performance rating
- Forces consideration of business constraints, not just product and engineering

**When to Use**:
- For product areas with dedicated business ownership
- When business needs are frequently in tension with product/eng
- For companies with strong GM or business unit structures

**Benefits**:
- Prevents EM/PM coalition against "unreasonable business requests"
- Ensures business viability is factored into decisions
- Creates three-way partnership instead of two vs. one dynamic

### Step 4: Seek Deep Understanding Before Solving
When conflicts arise, prioritize understanding over quick solutions:

**Before You Try to Solve the Conflict**:
1. Stop proposing solutions
2. Ask questions to understand what the other person actually cares about
3. Identify the true needs (often different from stated positions)
4. Look for underlying constraints they're navigating

**Example Scenario**:
- **Surface issue**: PM keeps prioritizing a rewrite into new programming language
- **EM reaction**: "This is idiotic, why are we doing this?"
- **Better approach**: "You keep prioritizing this rewrite. What's going on?"
- **Possible real reason**: Engineers are threatening to leave if they don't get interesting work
- **Real constraint**: EM has invisible constraint (retention) that PM can't see

**Will's Insight**: "Once you understand, you might not agree with them, but at least you can have an honest conversation about how to navigate those constraints versus just like, 'Man, you won't believe what my EM partner did today. This bozo did blah, blah, blah.'"

### Step 5: Avoid Villain/Victim Narratives
Reframe how you think about your counterpart:

**Bad Mental Model**: "PM is saying yes because they want to get promoted because the salesperson will review their promotion"

**Reality**: "It's really never that simple"
- The business needs to sell to remain functioning
- You can't just say no and have the business succeed
- PMs navigate complex pressures that aren't visible to EMs
- EMs navigate complex pressures (team morale, technical debt, on-call burden) that aren't visible to PMs

**Principle**: "There are no villains in the workplace. There are just people with complex incentives doing complex things."

**Action**: When frustrated, ask yourself:
- What constraint might they be navigating that I can't see?
- What would success look like from their perspective?
- How are they being evaluated that might drive this behavior?

### Step 6: Navigate the "Interesting Work" Problem
Address the EM's invisible constraint around engineer satisfaction:

**The Challenge**:
- Past decade: EM job heavily focused on retention
- EMs told by their teams they need "interesting work"
- This creates invisible constraint PMs don't understand
- Results in EMs seeming unreliable when they push for rewrites or new tech

**Example**:
- Growth team needs to run 50 A/B test experiments
- Engineers want to build "something brand new"
- EM caught between PM's needs and team's demands
- EM may push back on experiments, seeming difficult

**Solutions**:
1. **Make the constraint visible**: EM should explicitly tell PM about team's interesting work needs
2. **Collaborative problem-solving**: Find interesting challenges within business priorities
3. **Reframe "interesting"**: Help team see complexity and learning in business-critical work
4. **Organizational shift**: With market changes, less coddling, more accountability (see Staff Engineer framework)
5. **Strategic constraints**: Use engineering strategy to limit "interesting work" demands (e.g., standard toolkit)

### Step 7: Find Compromise Solutions
Once you understand each other's needs, find solutions that satisfy both:

**Will's Insight**: "If you really deeply understand what everyone wants, there's usually a compromised solution that gives everyone exactly what they want."

**Process**:
1. Articulate PM's true needs (not positions)
2. Articulate EM's true needs (not positions)
3. Look for solutions that address both
4. Be willing to dig deeper—first attempt often not the best

**Common False Trade-offs**:
- "Speed vs. quality" (often can have both with right scoping)
- "New features vs. technical debt" (can often blend)
- "Interesting work vs. business needs" (can reframe business needs to show complexity)

**Example**:
- **PM needs**: Ship feature to major customer by Q2
- **EM needs**: Engineers want to work on infrastructure
- **Surface conflict**: Sales-driven feature vs. technical work
- **Deeper understanding**:
  - PM actually needs: Prove value to customer, can be staged
  - EM actually needs: Engineers see strategic technical challenges
- **Compromise**: Stage 1 quick (meets customer), Stage 2 includes infrastructure work that makes it scale (meets engineers), both aligned on outcome

## Expected Outcomes
- Reduced EM/PM conflict and finger-pointing
- Faster resolution of disagreements
- Better trade-off decisions that consider all constraints
- More trust and psychological safety between EMs and PMs
- Improved team outcomes (delivery + quality + morale)
- Less time escalating to leadership

## Common Pitfalls

### Pitfall 1: Shared Rating Feels Unfair
**Problem**: "Why should I get a bad rating because my counterpart is struggling?"
**Solution**: Exceptions exist for clear individual non-performance (not showing up, obvious skill gaps). But in most cases, if partnership isn't working, both share responsibility. The goal is to drive collaboration, not punishment.

### Pitfall 2: Quick to Solutions, Slow to Understanding
**Problem**: Jumping to solve conflicts before understanding root needs.
**Solution**: Discipline yourself to ask 3-5 clarifying questions before proposing any solution. Seek to understand constraints you can't see.

### Pitfall 3: Keeping Constraints Invisible
**Problem**: EM doesn't tell PM about team morale issues; PM doesn't tell EM about sales pressure.
**Solution**: Make invisible constraints visible. Share the pressures you're under. Build trust through transparency.

### Pitfall 4: Villain/Victim Storytelling
**Problem**: Building narratives about how your counterpart is incompetent or malicious.
**Solution**: Remember there are no villains. Ask: What incentives or constraints might explain this behavior?

### Pitfall 5: Not Involving Leadership
**Problem**: EMs and PMs struggle alone without leadership support or aligned incentives.
**Solution**: Engineering and Product leadership (VPE/CTO and VP/CPO) must align on this approach and model it themselves.

### Pitfall 6: Applying Same Rating Mechanically
**Problem**: Giving same rating without actually calibrating on true performance.
**Solution**: Actually spend time calibrating together. Discuss nuances. Make exceptions where warranted, but default to shared.

## Real-World Example: Growth Team Conflict

### Scenario
- **PM need**: Run 50 experiments this quarter (growth strategy)
- **Engineer want**: Build brand new system (interesting work)
- **EM position**: Can't just run boring experiments, team will leave
- **PM position**: Experiments are the strategy, EM is blocking
- **Surface conflict**: Appears intractable

### Applying Framework

**Step 1: Diagnose**
- Incentive issue: PM evaluated on experiments run, EM evaluated on retention
- Understanding issue: PM doesn't know about engineer dissatisfaction; EM doesn't understand growth strategy importance

**Step 2: Make Constraints Visible**
- EM shares: "My team is threatening to leave if we don't do something technically interesting"
- PM shares: "These experiments are how we prove our growth hypothesis; without them, we lose funding"

**Step 3: Seek Deep Understanding**
- What do engineers actually mean by "interesting"? (Could be: autonomy, complexity, learning, impact, novelty)
- What flexibility exists in experiment execution? (Could some be technically complex?)
- What's the real timeline? (Might be able to batch differently)

**Step 4: Find Compromise**
- Batch experiments into a framework (technically interesting infrastructure)
- Rotate engineers between experiment execution and framework improvement
- Highlight statistical rigor and learning (interesting to analytical engineers)
- Commit to technical investment in Q2 after establishing experiment baseline

**Step 5: Shared Accountability**
- Both EM and PM evaluated on: experiments run AND team health
- Forces both to solve for complete problem
- Removes incentive to blame each other

### Context Signals
Trigger this SOP when detecting:
- EM/PM conflict or tension
- Questions about partnership structure
- Performance evaluation questions for EMs or PMs
- Complaints about misaligned incentives
- Finger-pointing between product and engineering
- Questions about team structure and accountability

### Adaptation Guidance
- **For small startups**: May not need formal shared ratings yet; focus on understanding framework
- **For large enterprises**: May need to work within existing review systems; can still apply shared accountability principles
- **For product-led companies**: May extend to design as well (EM/PM/Design trio)
- **For technical-first companies**: May need more emphasis on business constraints (use trifecta)
- **During conflicts**: Start with Step 4 (seeking understanding) before proposing structural changes

### Key Principles to Emphasize
1. There are no villains—only people with complex, often invisible constraints
2. Seek to understand before seeking to solve
3. Shared incentives drive shared problem-solving
4. True needs often differ from stated positions
5. Most "hard trade-offs" have compromise solutions if you dig deep enough

### Common Misapplications
- Using shared ratings punitively rather than to drive collaboration
- Skipping the "seek understanding" phase
- Applying mechanically without leadership alignment
- Not making exceptions for clear individual performance issues
- Focusing only on structure (shared ratings) without culture (understanding, no villains)

### Example Prompts for AI Application
"My PM keeps saying yes to sales requests" → Guide through understanding constraints before solving
"How should we structure EM/PM accountability?" → Explain shared rating approach with adaptation guidance
"EM and PM are in constant conflict" → Diagnose: incentives or understanding? Then appropriate remedy
"Should engineers work on technical debt or features?" → False trade-off; help find compromise through understanding true needs
