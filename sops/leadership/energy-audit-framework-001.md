- **Difficulty**: Beginner

## Overview
A systematic two-week process to identify and eliminate energy-draining activities from your calendar, enabling you to spend 80% of your time in your "zone of genius" where you create maximum value and experience fulfillment. This framework helps you discover what truly energizes you by elimination rather than addition.

## When to Use
- When feeling chronically drained or burned out
- When successful but not fulfilled
- When calendar is full but output doesn't match time invested
- Before major role transitions or restructuring
- When building a new team and defining roles
- Quarterly or annually as maintenance check

## Prerequisites
- Two weeks of representative calendar data (typical work, not vacation/unusual periods)
- Willingness to delegate or eliminate activities
- Authority to restructure your role (or manager's support to do so)
- Honesty about what you actually enjoy vs. what you think you should enjoy

## Procedure

### Step 1: Understand the Four Zones

**Zone of Incompetence**
- You're not good at it; someone else is better
- Example: Fixing a car, technical tasks outside expertise
- Action: Delegate or outsource immediately

**Zone of Competence**
- You can do it fine, but so can someone else
- Example: Cleaning house, basic administrative work
- Takes significant time without creating unique value
- Action: Delegate or outsource

**Zone of Excellence** (THE DANGER ZONE)
- You're uniquely good at it, but you don't love it
- Others want you to do it; you get paid well for it
- Creates value but drains life force
- Prevents you from becoming amazing
- Example: A skill you developed that pays bills but doesn't excite you
- Action: Transition away gradually while developing zone of genius

**Zone of Genius**
- Uniquely good at it AND you love it so much you don't notice you're doing it
- Time and space disappear when engaged
- Often undervalued by you because it comes easily
- Example: The thing you'd do for free
- Action: Maximize time spent here

**Key insight**: "It's not that you figure out what [your zone of genius] is and do more of that, it's that you figure out what it isn't and eliminate that and then naturally, you'll be drawn toward what it is that you love."

### Step 2: Capture Two Weeks of Activity Data

**Calendar preparation:**
1. Select two representative weeks (avoid vacation, unusual events)
2. Review calendar and identify all scheduled meetings
3. Fill in gaps between meetings with what you actually did
   - Email processing
   - Ad-hoc conversations
   - Slack/messaging
   - Independent work
   - Social media/breaks
   - Administrative tasks
4. Account for every hour from 8 AM to 6 PM (or your typical work hours)
5. Be honest - this only works if you capture reality, not the ideal

**Granularity**: Hour-by-hour is sufficient; 30-minute blocks if you want more precision

### Step 3: Mark Energy Impact

**Evaluation process:**
1. Get green and red markers (physical or digital highlighting)
2. At the end of each hour (or end of day), ask:
   - "At the end of this hour, did I have MORE energy or LESS energy than at the start?"
3. Mark each hour:
   - **Green** = More energy (energizing)
   - **Red** = Neutral or negative energy (draining)
4. Complete this for all activities across both weeks

**Important**: This is about energy, not productivity or value created

### Step 4: Identify Red Patterns

**Analysis:**
1. Review all red (energy-draining) activities
2. Look for themes and patterns:
   - Types of meetings (1-on-1s, team meetings, exec meetings)
   - Types of people (reports, peers, external)
   - Types of tasks (recruiting, admin, email)
   - Time of day (morning vs afternoon)
   - Meeting structure (prepared vs unprepared, verbal vs written)

**Common red patterns Matt has observed:**
- One-on-ones with people no longer as direct reports
- Team meetings where nothing was prepared in advance (all verbal)
- Recruiting interviews with people ultimately not hired
- Informational interviews providing no value
- Email/Slack responding to others' priorities

### Step 5: Eliminate, Delegate, or Transform Red Activities

**For each red activity, ask three questions in order:**

**Question 1: Does this need to be done at all?**
- If NO → Cancel it permanently
- If YES → Go to Question 2
- Examples of cancelable:
  - Informational interviews you don't want
  - Status meetings where async updates would work
  - "Just in case" recurring meetings

**Question 2: Does someone else can do it?**
- If YES → Delegate it to them
- If NO → Go to Question 3
- Examples of delegatable:
  - Interviews after you've defined criteria (recruiter can do first pass)
  - One-on-ones that report can own
  - Data analysis someone else can run

**Question 3: It needs to be done and only I can do it**
- Ask: "What would make this exquisite?"
- Identify the specific changes that would transform it from red to green

### Step 6: Design Exquisite Versions

**Example transformation - Executive team meeting:**

Current (RED):
- 3-hour meeting
- People show up unprepared
- All updates delivered verbally
- Problems raised without proposed solutions
- Lots of back-and-forth clarification

What would make it exquisite (GREEN):
- Everyone pre-writes their update:
  - Progress against priorities (red/yellow/green)
  - What they did last week
  - What they'll do this week
  - Problems identified with proposed solutions
- First 15 minutes: Silent reading and async decision-making
- Remaining 30 minutes: Only discuss items needing real-time discussion
- Meeting reduced from 3 hours to 45 minutes

**Implementation:**
1. Write up what would make it exquisite
2. Share with the group: "This is what would make this meeting exquisite for me. What do you think?"
3. Nine out of 10 times, people agree because they feel the same way
4. Implement new methodology
5. Iterate based on results

### Step 7: Iterate Toward 80% Green

**Ongoing process:**
1. Implement changes from first audit
2. Wait 2-4 weeks for new patterns to stabilize
3. Run another two-week energy audit
4. Identify remaining reds and repeat elimination/transformation
5. Continue until calendar is 80% green

**Timeline**: Typically requires 2-3 full audit cycles to reach 80% green

**Matt's promise**: "Once that happens, magic will occur. All of a sudden, your life will become phenomenal and you will start to create massive value."

### Step 8: Apply to Team Role Design

**Team-wide energy audit:**
1. Have entire team complete individual energy audits
2. Share results in group setting (optional but powerful)
3. Discover that for everything one person hates, someone else loves it
4. Redistribute responsibilities based on energy profiles
5. Results in better performance AND higher morale

**Example from Brex**:
- Co-CEOs did energy audit together
- Discovered one loved internal meetings, other loved external meetings
- Redistributed responsibilities accordingly
- "Changed the trajectory of the company"
- Rolled out to all managers with continued success

## Common Pitfalls

**Pitfall 1: Confusing "important" with "energizing"**
- **Mistake**: Marking things green because they're high-value, not because they energize you
- **Fix**: The question is energy only - did you have MORE energy after, regardless of importance?
- **Why it matters**: Zone of excellence (important but draining) is the trap to avoid

**Pitfall 2: Trying to optimize before eliminating**
- **Mistake**: Immediately asking "how do I do this better?" instead of "should I do this at all?"
- **Fix**: Always ask eliminate/delegate first, optimize last
- **Reason**: Most efficient meeting is one that doesn't happen

**Pitfall 3: Not being honest about what energizes you**
- **Mistake**: Marking things green because you think you should enjoy them
- **Fix**: This is private data; be ruthlessly honest or framework fails
- **Example**: "I should enjoy strategy meetings" but they actually drain you

**Pitfall 4: Believing you can't change your role**
- **Mistake**: "This is my job description, I have to do these things"
- **Fix**: Almost everything is negotiable; test before assuming
- **Evidence**: When you share "what would make it exquisite," 9/10 times people agree

**Pitfall 5: Skipping the iteration cycles**
- **Mistake**: Running one audit and stopping
- **Fix**: Requires 2-3 full cycles to reach 80% green
- **Timeline**: Allow 6-9 months for complete transformation

**Pitfall 6: Not accounting for energy vampires outside meetings**
- **Mistake**: Only evaluating formal calendar items
- **Fix**: Fill in ALL time, including email, Slack, breaks, etc.
- **Hidden drain**: Constantly responding to others' priorities

**Pitfall 7: Assuming others want you in zone of excellence**
- **Mistake**: "But I'm good at this and they pay me for it"
- **Fix**: You create far more value in zone of genius; trust the reallocation
- **Reframe**: What you're good at but don't love prevents you from being amazing

## AI Integration Notes

**Context signals that should trigger this SOP:**
- User expresses burnout or lack of fulfillment
- User successful but not enjoying work
- User asking how to find their calling/purpose
- User managing team with morale issues
- User asking about work-life balance
- Phrases: "busy but not productive", "successful but unfulfilled", "don't know what I'm good at"

**How to adapt for different situations:**
- **Individual contributors**: May have less authority to change role; focus on micro-decisions and proposing changes
- **Managers**: Can run team-wide version for powerful results
- **Founders/CEOs**: Have maximum flexibility; can restructure entire role
- **Career transitions**: Use to evaluate new opportunities against energy profile
- **Team building**: Use energy profiles to design roles before hiring

**Limitations and edge cases:**
- Requires 2-week commitment to data collection
- Some roles have genuinely less flexibility (recommend role change if 80% can't be achieved)
- Early-stage startups may require doing non-energizing work temporarily
- May reveal need for significant role change or career pivot
- Cultural factors: Some cultures emphasize duty over fulfillment (balance appropriately)

**Success signals to track:**
- User completes first two-week audit
- User successfully eliminates or delegates at least 3 red activities
- User reports increased energy/fulfillment
- User runs subsequent audit cycles
- User approaches 80% green threshold
