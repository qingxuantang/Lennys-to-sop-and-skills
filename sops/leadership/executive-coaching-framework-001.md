## Overview
A comprehensive framework for understanding what executive coaching is, when it's valuable, how to find the right coach, and what to expect from the coaching relationship. Coaching is distinct from mentoring or advising - it's a creative partnership focused on helping you reach your goals through internal development rather than external advice.

## When to Use
- Facing a career milestone or crossroads (new CPO, VP role, CEO position)
- Making a major transition (big company to startup, new industry)
- Sensing "what got me here won't get me there"
- Feeling stuck, burned out, or at a plateau
- Recognizing that internal work is needed, not just skills or tactics
- Having already mastered frameworks, advice, and tactics but still not breaking through
- Seeking transformation in who you are, not just what you do

## Prerequisites
- Recognition that growth comes from internal work, not just external advice
- Willingness to engage in self-examination and vulnerability
- Openness to defining success internally rather than externally
- Understanding that coaching is a journey, not a quick fix
- Financial resources or company support for coaching investment

## What Coaching Is (and Isn't)

### Coaching IS:
- **A creative partnership** focused on your goals and potential
- **Client-driven**: You define success and bring the agenda
- **Whole-person work**: Not limited to work, leadership, or product
- **Exploratory and jazz-like**: Following where meaning and change emerge
- **About internal development**: Redesigning your internal operating system
- **Listening, curiosity, intuition**: Coach brings these tools, not answers

### Coaching IS NOT:
- **Mentoring**: Sharing "this is how I did it" advice
- **Advising**: Telling you what to do based on experience
- **Therapy**: Though it involves personal work, focus is on performance/goals
- **Teaching**: Transferring knowledge or skills
- **Having an agenda**: Coach doesn't have predetermined outcomes

### The Limitation of Advice
**Why advice feels good but often doesn't create change**:
- Like "cotton candy" - nice sugar high, but no nutrition
- Doesn't confront the real problem
- Often isn't relevant (what worked at Google may not work elsewhere)
- Creates dependency rather than capability
- Doesn't address underlying beliefs or assumptions

**Example**: "You could tell them what I did, tell them what Google did, and that'll answer all their questions. But a couple weeks later, a couple months later, nothing's really changed."

## Procedure

### Step 1: Recognize You Might Benefit from Coaching
**Self-Assessment Questions**:
- Have I mastered skills, frameworks, tactics but still feel stuck?
- Is my challenge more about who I am than what I know?
- Do I keep getting the same feedback without changing?
- Am I facing a transition where my old approach won't work?
- Do I have mentors and advisors but still feel something's missing?
- Am I introspective and ready for internal work?

**Key Indicator**: "A lot of the work is going to be internal work that's going to get me to the next level. This transformation is going to be just as much what I need to do as who I am."

### Step 2: Understand What You're Looking For
**Clarify Your Needs**:
- Do you want advice or exploration?
- Do you believe there's a "right way" or that you need to find "your way"?
- Are you looking for tactical help or transformational growth?
- Do you want structure or flexibility in sessions?

**Coaching vs Mentoring Decision Guide**:
- **Seek Mentoring if**: You need to learn the tutorial, want specific advice, early in career
- **Seek Coaching if**: You've learned the basics, recognize that "your way" must emerge from within

### Step 3: Find Potential Coaches
**Where to Look**:
- **International Coaching Federation (ICF)**: Directory of credentialed coaches
- **Matchmaking Services**: BetterUp, Torch, Prismaticco (higher-end)
- **Personal Network**: Ask leaders you admire who they work with
- **Industry Lists**: E.g., Scale's list of top coaches for product managers
- **Price Range**: Wide variety - don't assume you can't afford coaching without looking

**Important Note**: You don't need a coach who's done your job. Coaches are trained to coach on any topic. Sometimes a coach without product experience is better (prevents them from slipping into advising).

### Step 4: Evaluate Coaches (Free Sessions)
**Have Initial Conversations with 3-5 Coaches**

**Questions to Ask**:
1. **"What is coaching to you?"**
   - Reveals their philosophy and approach
   - Shows whether they blend mentoring, advising, or pure coaching

2. **"What's your style and structure?"**
   - Some are highly structured (week 1 this, week 2 that)
   - Some are client-led (you bring agenda each session)
   - Some blend approaches

3. **"Can you share your background and who you typically work with?"**
   - While they don't need your exact background, understanding their experience helps

4. **Request a Sample Session**
   - All good coaches offer free initial sessions
   - This should be actual coaching, not just talking about coaching
   - Pay attention to how it feels

### Step 5: Assess Fit
**Trust Your Gut**:
- Does it "click"?
- Do you feel comfortable being vulnerable?
- Do their questions make you think differently?
- Do you leave feeling energized or deflated?

**Consider Preferences**:
- Gender, age, background that makes you comfortable
- Style: touchy-feely vs. drill sergeant
- Approach: emotional work vs. action-oriented
- Structure: loose vs. highly structured

**Red Flags**:
- Coach talks more than listens
- Coach gives lots of advice instead of asking questions
- You don't feel safe being honest
- Coach seems to have predetermined outcomes for you

**Key Principle**: "It either has to be a fit or not. Sometimes it's hard to put your finger on it. Sometimes you meet with someone and you're like, 'Yeah, it clicks. It feels right.' Sometimes you're like, 'Eh, it doesn't,' and that's okay."

### Step 6: Commit to the Process
**Typical Coaching Engagement**:
- **Frequency**: Usually bi-weekly or monthly sessions
- **Duration**: 6-12 months minimum for meaningful change
- **Session Length**: 60-90 minutes typical
- **Homework**: Reflection, exercises, or practices between sessions

**Set Expectations**:
- This is a partnership - you do the work
- Change takes time - this isn't a quick fix
- You bring the agenda to each session
- Success is defined by you, not the coach

### Step 7: Engage Actively in Coaching Sessions
**How Sessions Typically Work**:
1. **You bring the topic**: "What do you want to talk about today?"
2. **Coach asks questions**: To help you explore, not to give answers
3. **You discover insights**: Through your own exploration and thinking
4. **Coach challenges assumptions**: Helps you see things differently
5. **You define actions**: Based on what emerged, not coach's advice

**Tools Coach Might Use**:
- Powerful questions
- Noticing patterns or connections
- Naming emotions or inner voices
- Reframing perspectives
- Challenging underlying beliefs
- Creating space for imagination
- Bypassing the inner critic

### Step 8: Apply Between Sessions
**Self-Coaching Practices**:
- Notice when emotions arise and ask yourself coaching questions
- Journal on insights from sessions
- Practice new ways of being in low-stakes situations
- Bring observations back to next session

**Coaching Questions to Ask Yourself**:
- What's really important to me here?
- What am I afraid of?
- What belief is driving this behavior?
- What if the opposite were true?
- What would operating from purpose look like?
- What's the creative response vs. reactive response?

### Step 9: Measure Progress Your Way
**Signs of Progress** (examples - yours may differ):
- Greater clarity on what matters to you
- Reduced anxiety or fear in challenging situations
- More authentic leadership expression
- Better alignment between values and actions
- Improved relationships with team/stakeholders
- Increased effectiveness and impact
- More energy and less burnout

**Important**: Progress is self-defined. Your goals and measures matter, not external benchmarks.

## Expected Outcomes
- Deeper self-awareness and understanding
- Clarity on authentic leadership style
- Resolution of recurring challenges or patterns
- Greater alignment between actions and values
- Internal operating system redesigned for current demands
- Sustainable path forward in career
- Tools for ongoing self-coaching
- Increased effectiveness and satisfaction

## Common Pitfalls

### Pitfall 1: Expecting the Coach to Have Answers
**Problem**: Wanting coach to tell you what to do
**Reality**: Coaching is about you finding your answers, not receiving their answers
**Solution**: Embrace the exploration; trust that your insights will be more powerful than their advice

### Pitfall 2: Not Being Ready for Internal Work
**Problem**: Wanting tactical advice or skills when you sign up for coaching
**Reality**: "If you're looking for someone to teach you the tutorial and there's this jackass like me sitting next to you saying, 'What's important to you about playing this video game?' you're going to be like, 'Just can you tell me how to hold the controller?'"
**Solution**: Seek mentoring or training first; return to coaching when you're ready

### Pitfall 3: Judging Fit Too Quickly
**Problem**: Deciding on first coach you talk to, or dismissing all coaches after one bad fit
**Reality**: Fit matters enormously; it's worth talking to several
**Solution**: Have 3-5 initial conversations before deciding

### Pitfall 4: Assuming You Can't Afford It
**Problem**: Not exploring coaching because of perceived cost
**Reality**: Wide range of coaches at different price points; company may pay
**Solution**: Actually look at options before deciding it's not accessible

### Pitfall 5: Expecting Quick Results
**Problem**: Wanting transformation in a few sessions
**Reality**: Meaningful change is developmental and takes time
**Solution**: Commit to at least 6 months; this is a journey

### Pitfall 6: Requiring Product Background
**Problem**: Only considering coaches who were product leaders
**Reality**: Coaches are trained to coach on any topic; PM background not required
**Solution**: Consider coaches from other backgrounds; it may actually help them stay in coaching mode

### Pitfall 7: Not Doing the Work Between Sessions
**Problem**: Treating coaching like therapy where you just show up and talk
**Reality**: You're the one doing the work; coach facilitates
**Solution**: Engage with practices, reflection, and application between sessions
