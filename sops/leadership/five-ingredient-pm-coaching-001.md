- **Applicable To**: Product Leads, Team Leads, Product Directors, Managers of PMs
- **Difficulty**: Intermediate

## Overview
A structured five-step framework for coaching and developing product managers that focuses on creating clarity, alignment, and consistent growth. This approach helps product leaders systematically develop their direct reports without requiring massive time investment.

## When to Use
- When you're a new manager of product managers
- When you want to improve the effectiveness of your PM coaching
- When your product people seem stuck in their development
- When you need to scale people development across your product team
- When you lack formal training in coaching product managers

## Prerequisites
- You manage at least one product manager
- You have regular 1-on-1 meetings scheduled
- You have basic understanding of product management practices
- You can dedicate 1-2 hours per quarter per direct report for development planning

## Procedure

### Step 1: Define Your Compass (What is "Good"?)
Create a clear definition of what a good product manager looks like in your context.

**Action Items:**
- Reflect on both personality traits and skills/capabilities you value
- Separate "must hire for" traits (curiosity, empathy) from "can develop" skills (prioritization, user interviews)
- Use existing frameworks as starting points (PMwheel, PM Daisy, Marty Cagan's assessment)
- Customize any template to fit your organization's specific needs
- Document your definition - make it explicit rather than implicit

**Important Distinctions:**
- **Personality traits**: Hard to develop, hire for these (curiosity, empathy)
- **Skills & know-how**: Can be coached and developed (prioritization, interviewing, storytelling)
- **Context-specific**: Technical PMs may need different competencies than consumer PMs

**Note**: Don't wait for company-wide alignment. Start with your own team's compass and harmonize later if needed.

### Step 2: Assess Current State & Envision Next Challenge
Understand where each PM is today and identify their next growth opportunity.

**Action Items:**
- Put the "pin on the map" - assess where each PM currently is in their career
- Consider their situation holistically (career, life context, current role)
- Create a vision for their future - think bigger than their current role/company
- Identify the "next bigger challenge" for each person

**Quarterly Exercise (1 hour):**
1. Block calendar time once per quarter
2. Write down names of all direct reports
3. For each person, answer: "What would be the next bigger challenge that would help them learn a new skill or capability?"
4. Document these challenges even if they're not immediately available
5. Review list regularly to spot opportunities as they arise

**Key Insight**: The "next bigger challenge" might not come for 1-3 quarters, but documenting it helps you recognize the opportunity when it appears.

### Step 3: Share Vision & Create Alignment
Have an open conversation about your vision for their development.

**Action Items:**
- Schedule dedicated time to share your vision for their growth
- Frame it as opening up their thinking, not dictating their path
- Practice "seeing them" - recognize their strengths and potential
- Encourage and bring out the best in them
- Listen to their own vision and aspirations
- Find alignment between your vision and theirs

**Conversation Framework:**
- "Here's what I see as possible for you..."
- "What resonates with you about this?"
- "What's your vision for yourself?"
- "Where do you see gaps between where you are and where you want to be?"

### Step 4: Co-Create Development Plan
Work together to create an actionable plan, but remember: they own it, not you.

**Critical Principle**: "You don't get the abs from other people's branches" - they must do the work.

**Action Items:**
- Help them see differences between your "definition of good" and their current profile
- Identify 1-3 focus areas for the next 3-4 months
- Define specific, small learning actions:
  - Read a specific book
  - Give a presentation at a conference
  - Shadow someone who does this well
  - Experiment with a new technique
  - Reflect on current approach and compare to alternatives

**Development Plan Structure:**
- **Focus Area**: One skill/capability (e.g., "storytelling capabilities")
- **Current Gap**: Why this matters now
- **Learning Actions**: 3-5 specific, small steps
- **Timeline**: 3-4 months per plan
- **Success Indicators**: How they'll know they've improved

**Pro Tip**: If you don't have time for full assessment, start here. Use what they already know they want to improve.

### Step 5: Commit to Follow-Up
Create accountability through consistent, lightweight check-ins.

**Action Items:**
- Ask them: "How do you want to be reminded about your development plan?"
- Some need weekly nudges, others monthly check-ins
- Use water cooler moments: "Hey, how's it going with your personal development plan?"
- Respect that development is never the #1 priority - they have a day job
- Make it easy with small, consistent touchpoints

**Follow-Up Options:**
- Weekly quick check-ins (2 minutes)
- Monthly 1-on-1 agenda item
- Quarterly deep review with color-coded status
- Email reminders
- Slack check-ins

**Consistency Principle**: "Consistency beats intensity" - small regular investments work better than big bang reviews.

## Expected Outcomes
- PMs have clear understanding of what "good" looks like
- Development becomes systematic rather than ad-hoc
- Line managers spend less time on crisis coaching
- PMs feel seen, valued, and supported
- Skills gaps are addressed proactively
- Team capability grows over time
- Retention improves as people feel they're learning and growing

## Common Pitfalls

**Pitfall 1: Waiting for Perfect Company-Wide Alignment**
- **Mistake**: Delaying coaching until HR creates unified framework across all product teams
- **Solution**: Start with your own compass for your team. You can harmonize later.

**Pitfall 2: Treating Development as Your Responsibility**
- **Mistake**: Trying to "make" your PMs develop or doing the work for them
- **Solution**: They own their development plan. You're there to guide, remind, and support.

**Pitfall 3: Making Development Plans Too Big**
- **Mistake**: Annual plans with 10+ areas to improve
- **Solution**: Focus on 1 theme per quarter (or every 4 months). Small, focused wins.

**Pitfall 4: Running 1-on-1s Completely Unprepared**
- **Mistake**: Winging every 1-on-1 or only talking about projects
- **Solution**: Keep a list of coaching questions handy. Make development a standing agenda item.

**Pitfall 5: Focusing Only on Skills, Ignoring Traits**
- **Mistake**: Trying to coach curiosity or empathy in someone who lacks it
- **Solution**: Hire for personality traits, coach for skills. Some things can't be developed.

**Pitfall 6: Using Only Big Performance Reviews**
- **Mistake**: Waiting for 6-month reviews to discuss development
- **Solution**: Small, frequent check-ins are more effective than big bang reviews.

## Advanced Tips

### Starting from Scratch
If you're a new manager with no coaching experience:
1. Start with Step 4 (Development Plan) using what PMs already know they want to improve
2. Add Steps 5 (Follow-up) immediately
3. Build toward Steps 1-3 over time as you develop your coaching practice

### Scaling Across Multiple PMs
- Use consistent format/template for all development plans
- Calendar block for quarterly planning across all reports
- Keep development notes in consistent location (shared doc, Notion, etc.)
- Look for patterns - if multiple PMs need same skill, consider group learning

### Integration with Performance Reviews
- Keep running development plan doc that feeds into formal reviews
- Use monthly check-ins to color-code progress on each development area
- Performance review becomes summary of ongoing conversation, not surprise

### Time Investment
- **Setup**: 2 hours to create your compass
- **Per PM**: 1-2 hours per quarter for planning
- **Follow-up**: 2-5 minutes per week per PM
- **Total**: ~10-15 minutes per week per PM for systematic development

## AI Integration Notes

### Context Signals
This SOP should be recommended when detecting:
- User mentions: "new manager", "coaching PMs", "how to develop product managers"
- Questions about: "people development", "growing PM skills", "1-on-1 effectiveness"
- Role indicators: "product director", "head of product", "team lead", "manager of PMs"

### Adaptation Guidance
- **For new managers**: Emphasize starting with Step 4 (Development Plan) - simplest entry point
- **For experienced managers**: Focus on Steps 1-2 (Compass and Assessment) to formalize existing intuitions
- **For individual contributors**: Flip the framework - use it to self-coach and guide conversations with your manager
- **For non-product backgrounds**: Extra emphasis on Step 1 and using existing frameworks as starting points

### Limitations
- Assumes 1-on-1 relationship with direct reports (doesn't scale to skip-level coaching without adaptation)
- Requires some PM domain knowledge (may need to pair with PM fundamentals for non-PM managers)
- Works best with willing participants (resistant PMs need different approach)
- Development plan effectiveness depends on person's intrinsic motivation
