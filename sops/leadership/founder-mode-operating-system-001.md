# Founder Mode Operating System

## Metadata
- **Source**: Brian Chesky - Lenny's Podcast
- **Domain**: Leadership / Company Building
- **Type**: Framework SOP
- **Applicable To**: Founders, CEOs, Product Leaders
- **Company Stage**: Scale (Series C+, post-PMF, 100+ employees)
- **Difficulty**: Advanced

## Overview
This SOP describes the operating model Brian Chesky implemented at Airbnb after the pandemic—a shift from traditional divisional management to "founder mode" where the CEO remains deeply involved in product details, the entire company works from a single roadmap, and cross-functional execution replaces siloed teams.

## When to Use
- Company has grown but product innovation has slowed
- Multiple divisions going in different directions
- Politics and bureaucracy are increasing
- Best product people are leaving
- CEO feels disconnected from the product
- Costs are rising but growth is slowing
- You want to run like a startup at scale

## Prerequisites
- Founder/CEO commitment to being deeply involved
- Willingness to restructure organization
- Executive team that supports the approach
- Product-led company culture (or willingness to become one)

## Core Principle: Leaders Are in the Details

**Key insight**: There's a difference between micromanagement (telling people what to do) and being in the details (knowing what's happening).

- If you don't know the details, you can't know if people are doing a good job
- "Empowering" without visibility leads to misalignment
- The best leaders are expert practitioners, not just people managers

## Procedure

### Step 1: Diagnose the Current State

**Signs you need to change:**
- The less involved leadership is, the MORE spin occurs
- Teams assume slowness is from over-involvement, but it's under-involvement
- Products ship but customers can't name a single thing you did
- "Meetings about meetings about meetings"
- 80 hours worked, 20 hours of productive work
- Different groups on different tech stacks
- Dependency bottlenecks creating wait times
- Teams building their own versions of shared services

### Step 2: Document Everything

**First action:**
1. Require every team to write down everything they're doing
2. Put it in a single spreadsheet/document
3. Realize you can probably only do 20% of these things

**Key insight**: If teams can't document what they're doing, that's a red flag itself.

### Step 3: Cut Down to Essential Work

**The math:**
- One person doing three things = reasonable
- A thousand people doing three things each = 3,000 things
- Instead: Three teams should do one thing together

**Actions:**
- Cut projects aggressively (to ~20% of current work)
- If it's not on the roadmap, it doesn't ship
- Maintain reserve capacity for pivots

### Step 4: Restructure to Functional Model

**Replace divisions with functions:**

Old model (bad):
- Flights division
- Homes division (subdivided further)
- Business travel division
- Experiences division
- Each with own engineering, design, marketing

New model (good):
- Design (one function)
- Engineering (one function)
- Product Marketing (one function)
- Marketing and Communications (one function)
- Sales and Operations (one function)

**Benefits:**
- No divisional leaders advocating for resources
- No politics of "my division vs. yours"
- Everyone rows in same direction
- Designers and engineers are fungible across projects

### Step 5: Implement Single Rolling Roadmap

**Two-year rolling roadmap:**
- Updated every month
- Near-term (next month) doesn't change much
- Far-term (2 years out) changes frequently
- Major releases twice a year (May and November)

**How it works:**
- You can't ship something unless it's on the roadmap
- Strategy → Product roadmap → Execution
- Annual planning is just budgeting (1-2 weeks max)

### Step 6: Combine Product Management and Product Marketing

**The insight**: You can't build a product unless you know how to talk about it.

**New "Product Marketing" role:**
- Figures out how people will learn about the product
- Owns demos and storytelling
- Works months ahead on launch assets
- Manages by influence, not control

**Story dictates product:**
- Start with the story you'll tell
- Let story shape product decisions
- Result: Cohesive products that are explainable

### Step 7: Establish CEO Review Cadence

**Regular reviews of ALL work:**
- Every project reviewed: weekly, bi-weekly, monthly, or quarterly
- CEO sees the equivalent of "assembled product" each week
- Identify bottlenecks by seeing the work directly

**Scoring system:**
- Green: On track to ship
- Yellow: Some concerns
- Red: Needs intervention

**Benefits of reviews:**
- No bureaucracy needed—issues surface in reviews
- People don't need to "manage up" or politic
- CEO can feel individual contributor blockers
- Sets the pace for the entire company

### Step 8: Make Leaders Expert Practitioners

**No pure "people managers":**
- Design leaders should be designing with the team
- Engineering leaders should know the code
- "Manage the work first, the people second"

**Test**: Could this leader do the job themselves? If not, they shouldn't lead it.

### Step 9: Reduce Layers and Headcount

**Fewer, more senior people:**
- Remove layers between CEO and team leads
- Treat directs-of-directs as dotted-line reports
- Every direct-of-direct is implicitly connected to CEO

**Scale with leaders, not process:**
- Never scale with process alone
- Invest in developing great leaders
- Better to have fewer excellent people than many mediocre

### Step 10: Build In-House Creative Capabilities

**Own your creative:**
- Build internal creative agency
- Same team does product design AND marketing creative
- One voice across all touchpoints
- Combine UX writing and marketing writing

**Why:**
- Consistency across all customer experiences
- Faster iteration
- Deep product knowledge in creative work

## Expected Outcomes
- Products that look like "10 people built them" even with 1,000 employees
- Faster decision-making and shipping
- Reduced politics and bureaucracy
- Alignment across entire company
- Better talent retention (best people want this)
- Sustainable, quality growth

## Common Pitfalls

### Apologizing for how you want to run the company
- Don't negotiate between your vision and what employees want
- People want clarity and direction
- Mixed signals make everyone miserable

### Thinking delegation is always the answer
- Delegation without details leads to dysfunction
- Less involvement often → MORE problems, not fewer
- Founders leaving product = beginning of the end

### Giving teams what they ask for
- Teams often ask for more autonomy
- More autonomy without alignment = slower movement
- Alignment enables autonomy

### Treating speed as just "working harder"
- Speed comes from fast decisions
- Bias for action: "Let's stay until it's done"
- Don't schedule follow-up meetings—resolve now

## Implementation Timeline

**Year 1-2**: Most work happens here
- Restructuring
- Cutting projects
- Establishing reviews
- Training product marketing

**After Year 2**: Maintenance mode
- Less time invested
- More time available
- Good surprises outnumber bad
- Less reacting, more proacting

## AI Integration Notes

### Context signals that should trigger this SOP:
- User mentions "founder mode," "CEO involvement in product"
- Questions about scaling without losing speed
- Discussion of divisional vs. functional structures
- Leadership feeling disconnected from product

### How to adapt:
- For non-founders: Focus on "leader in the details" principles
- For smaller companies: May already operate this way
- For very large companies: Apply at business unit level

### Key quotes:
- "Leaders are in the details"
- "A thousand people could work, but it looks like 10 people did it"
- "Add a zero" - think 10X to break assumptions
