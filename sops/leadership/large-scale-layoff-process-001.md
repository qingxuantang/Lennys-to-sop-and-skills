# Large-Scale Layoff Implementation Process

## Metadata
- **Source**: Matt Mochary - Lenny's Podcast
- **Domain**: Leadership & Crisis Management
- **Type**: Process
- **Applicable To**: CEOs, Executives, HR Leaders conducting layoffs of 10+ people
- **Difficulty**: Advanced

## Overview
A battle-tested process for implementing layoffs at scale that preserves company performance, maintains trust, and treats departing employees humanely. The defining characteristic is ensuring every person hears the news from their manager in a one-on-one conversation, not via email or group announcement.

## When to Use
- Company-wide layoffs of 5% or more of workforce
- Department-wide restructuring affecting multiple people
- Economic conditions requiring significant cost reduction
- Preparing for runway extension (avoiding down round)
- Post-merger integration requiring headcount reduction
- Any situation requiring 10+ simultaneous terminations

## Prerequisites
- Executive alignment on total reduction needed (dollar amount, not just headcount)
- Clear timeline (can be executed in 48 hours for decision phase)
- All managers informed and prepared to deliver news
- HR support for legal compliance and logistics
- Financial modeling showing runway impact
- Communication plan for internal and external stakeholders

## Strategic Context

**Why companies perform better after layoffs:**
- 80% of costs in tech companies is payroll
- Every additional human creates geometric overhead
- Coordination costs increase non-linearly with headcount
- Information flow friction grows with team size
- Morale issues from people not feeling heard/valued

**Matt's observed outcomes**: "Within 60 days of each layoff, the CEO reported back to me: It's insane. I don't know how this happened, but the company's now operating better... on an absolute scale. We're putting out more features, more code. Our NPS is up."

**Recovery timeline based on implementation quality:**
- **Handled poorly**: 2 months to better performance
- **Handled well (this framework)**: 2 weeks to better performance

**The non-negotiable rule**: "The biggest marker between a botched layoff and a successful layoff is at the moment someone hears that they no longer have a job, did they hear it from their manager in a one-on-one?"

## Procedure

### Phase 1: Inner Circle Planning (24-48 hours)

**Step 1: Define the Inner Circle**
- Include ALL managers in the company (not just executives)
- This is everyone who manages people, regardless of level
- They need to be decision-makers for their teams
- Typically 10-30% of company depending on structure

**Step 2: Communicate the Financial Reality**
1. Share exactly how much cost needs to be reduced
2. Express in **dollars, not headcount**
   - Why dollars: Prevents gaming by cutting only junior people
   - Junior people often do the most work
   - Dollar targets force strategic thinking about roles
3. Break down by department/team based on their budget

**Example**: "Engineering needs to reduce $2M in annual comp costs. Finance needs to reduce $500K."

**Step 3: Distribute Decision Rights**
1. Each manager chooses who on their team gets let go
2. Do NOT have department heads choose for managers
   - Risk: Team lead told to let go three people: "That was crazy. Those are my three best people."
3. Managers must hit their dollar reduction target
4. Can be done in 48 hours

**DO NOT ask**: "Tell me who you can let go" → Answer will be "Nobody"
**DO say**: "You must reduce $X in costs. Come back with your plan in 48 hours."

### Phase 2: Morning Execution (One-on-One Notifications)

**Step 4: Manager Preparation**

Before any communication:
- All managers review their list one final time
- HR confirms legal compliance
- Severance packages prepared
- IT/access revocation plan ready (but not executed yet)
- Manager scripts reviewed

**Step 5: Simultaneous One-on-One Rollout**

**Critical timing**: All notifications happen same morning, within 3-4 hour window

**Process for each manager:**
1. Reach out via Slack/email: "Hey, can I talk to you for 15 minutes?"
2. Keep it normal - don't signal anything unusual
3. Schedule back-to-back-to-back meetings
   - Example: 9:00, 9:20, 9:40, 10:00, 10:20
4. Conduct each conversation using Compassionate Firing Framework

**Each conversation (15 minutes):**
1. Warning: "This is going to be a difficult conversation..." [30 seconds]
2. Message: "I'm letting you go. Here's why..." [1 minute]
3. Emotions: "I imagine you're feeling... would you be willing to share?" [3-5 minutes]
4. Active listening and making them feel heard [5 minutes]
5. Agent offer: "I want to schedule another hour tomorrow/this week to help you find your next role" [2 minutes]
6. Logistics: Severance, timing, next steps [2-3 minutes]

**Manager capacity**: Each manager can typically handle 6-12 of these conversations in one morning

### Phase 3: Afternoon All-Hands (Stay Team Communication)

**Step 6: All-Hands for Remaining Employees**

**Timing**: After all one-on-ones complete (typically 1-2 PM)

**Attendees**: Only the "stay team" (people not let go)

**Agenda (60 minutes):**

1. **State what happened** [5 minutes]
   - "This morning we let go X people, representing Y% of the company"
   - "This was incredibly difficult but necessary because [reason]"
   - Do NOT sugarcoat; be direct

2. **Address the three fear questions** [20 minutes]

   **Fear 1: "Is this going to happen to me?"**
   - Answer: "No. We cut deep so we only cut once."
   - "The people to your left and right and you, you are the stay team."
   - "This is the team we're building the company with going forward."
   - Critical to say this clearly and mean it

   **Fear 2: "Did these people get feedback they weren't performing?"**
   - Be honest about whether it was performance vs. role elimination
   - If performance: "Yes, they had received feedback"
   - If role elimination: "This wasn't about performance; we eliminated roles"

   **Fear 3: "Is the company dying? Are we going to implode?"**
   - Share the financial reality transparently
   - Show runway extension: "We now have X months of runway instead of Y"
   - Explain market conditions if relevant
   - Paint picture of path forward

3. **Open Q&A** [30 minutes]
   - Take all questions
   - Be transparent
   - If you don't know, say so
   - If you can't share due to legal reasons, say so

4. **Next steps** [5 minutes]
   - What happens tomorrow
   - When things return to normal
   - How to support departing colleagues

### Phase 4: Stay Team One-on-Ones (Emotional Processing)

**Step 7: Individual Processing Sessions**

**What most companies skip** (and why they take 60 days to recover instead of 2 weeks)

**Process:**
- Each person on stay team has one-on-one with their manager
- 60 minutes per person
- Must happen within 3-5 days of layoff
- Can be spread over multiple days

**Manager's role (100% listening):**

```
"I'd like to know your thoughts and feelings about what happened."
[Person shares]

"I think what you're telling me is:
- You feel sad because your three buddies are no longer here
- You feel anger because you think this is bullshit and why did we hire
  this many people if we're going to fire them - that was irresponsible
- You feel fear because you're not sure if the company's going to implode
  or if your job is safe

Is that right?"
```

**What this accomplishes:**
- Doesn't remove emotion entirely
- Knocks it down by ~25%
- Enough that person won't:
  - Quit in reaction
  - Stop working
  - Spread negativity
  - Make rash decisions
- Accelerates emotional recovery
- Within 2 weeks: They see company operating better, morale rebounds

**Why it works**: Making people feel heard releases trapped emotions. When emotions aren't released, they fester and create long-term PTSD in the organization.

## Three Elements = Two-Week Recovery

1. **Morning**: One-on-one notifications with compassion
2. **Afternoon**: All-hands addressing fear questions
3. **Following week**: One-on-ones with stay team

**Without element 3**: 60-day recovery
**With all three elements**: 2-week recovery

## Expected Outcomes

**Immediate (Day 1):**
- All affected employees notified personally by their manager
- Stay team understands what happened and why
- Minimal social media/press backlash
- Departing employees feel respected (not dehumanized)

**Short-term (2 weeks with full process, 60 days without):**
- Company operating better than before layoff
- Higher output per person
- Improved coordination
- Stay team morale recovering/stabilizing

**Long-term (2-3 months):**
- Company performing better on absolute scale (not just relative)
- Runway extended significantly
- Culture intact or stronger
- Departed employees successfully placed in new roles (via agent process)

**Matt's observation across 40+ layoffs**: "Even if it's handled incredibly poorly, the company ends up performing better. It just takes a little longer for people to recover."

## Common Pitfalls

**Pitfall 1: Communicating via email, Slack, or group announcement**
- **Mistake**: "Hey team, we're letting some people go. Check your email."
- **Impact**: "That's when people get really angry and start going on Twitter and newspapers... it feels dehumanizing."
- **Fix**: Every single person hears from their manager in one-on-one
- **Non-negotiable**: This is THE defining factor between botched and successful layoff

**Pitfall 2: Asking managers who they CAN let go**
- **Mistake**: "Tell me who you're willing to part with"
- **Response**: "Nobody"
- **Fix**: Give them a dollar target they must hit

**Pitfall 3: Letting department heads choose for team leads**
- **Mistake**: VP chooses which engineers to let go instead of team leads choosing
- **Impact**: Team leads lose trust, feel undermined, may quit
- **Fix**: Each manager chooses for their own direct reports

**Pitfall 4: Cutting by headcount instead of dollars**
- **Mistake**: "Each team must reduce by 15%"
- **Gaming**: Managers cut cheapest people (usually most junior)
- **Reality**: Junior people often do most work
- **Fix**: "Each team must reduce by $X in annual comp"

**Pitfall 5: Cutting multiple times**
- **Mistake**: Cut 10%, then 3 months later cut another 10%
- **Impact**: Creates PTSD in organization; "trauma one, trauma two, trauma three"
- **Fix**: "Cut deep so we only cut once"
- **Communicate**: "We cut deep so we only cut once" must be said and meant

**Pitfall 6: Skipping stay team one-on-ones**
- **Mistake**: "We did all-hands, that's enough"
- **Impact**: 60-day recovery instead of 2-week recovery
- **Fix**: Schedule 60-minute one-on-ones with every stay team member
- **ROI**: Spending 10-20 hours on this saves 6 weeks of productivity

**Pitfall 7: Not having clear financials**
- **Mistake**: Vague reasoning like "market conditions"
- **Impact**: Stay team doesn't believe company is stable
- **Fix**: Share specific runway numbers, reduction achieved, path forward

**Pitfall 8: Managers not becoming agents for departing employees**
- **Mistake**: "Good luck in your search"
- **Impact**: People feel abandoned, talk negatively about company
- **Fix**: Each manager actively helps their reports find next role (1-2 hours each)

**Pitfall 9: Cutting too conservatively**
- **Mistake**: "Let's cut just enough to get 6 more months"
- **Better**: Cut to get 18-24 months runway
- **Reason**: Avoid second round; better to cut deep once

## Decision Framework: How Much to Cut

**Conservative approach:**
- Extend runway by 6 months
- Risk: May need second round
- Result: Organizational PTSD

**Recommended approach:**
- Extend runway by 18-24 months
- Cut deep enough to be certain you're done
- Even if you cut too much, company operates better with fewer people

**Matt's data point**: "We've had companies that have laid off 50% of the company and the results have been frankly, phenomenal."

## Special Contexts

### Economic Downtimes (Market Correction)
**Scenario**: Growth stock valuations down 50-90%, need to avoid down round

**Approach**:
- Calculate: Can we avoid raising for 2-3 years?
- If no: How much to cut to make it possible?
- Frame to team: "Valuations may stay low for 2-3 years; we're cutting to avoid down round"
- Benefit: CEOs who've done this before know company gets better

### Post-Product-Market-Fit Over-hiring
**Scenario**: Hit PMF, raised big round, hired aggressively, created overhead

**Approach**:
- Return to WhatsApp/Instagram/Linear/Notion model: Keep team super small
- Cut back to essential team
- Frame: "We're optimizing for speed and efficiency"
- Ideal: "The best part is no part" (Elon Musk philosophy)

### First-Time CEO Layoffs
**Scenario**: CEO has never done layoff before

**Approach**:
- Connect them with CEOs who have done it successfully
- They'll hear: "The company actually gets better"
- Reduces fear about decision
- Still requires perfect execution

## Related SOPs

- Making People Feel Heard Framework
- Fear and Anger Framework (managing your own emotions as leader)
- Talent Density Framework

## AI Integration Notes

**Context signals that should trigger this SOP:**
- User mentions needing to do layoffs of 10+ people
- User asks about "reduction in force" or "RIF"
- User describes financial pressure requiring headcount cuts
- CEO asking about extending runway
- User mentions avoiding down round
- Phrases: "company-wide layoffs", "restructuring", "right-sizing"

**How to adapt for different situations:**
- **Small company (10-50 people)**: CEO may deliver all messages personally
- **Medium company (50-200)**: Managers deliver to their teams as described
- **Large company (200+)**: May need multiple days; keep it within one week maximum
- **Department-specific**: Same process but limited to affected department
- **Voluntary separation**: Can be less traumatic but follow same communication principles

**Critical success factors to emphasize:**
- One-on-one delivery is non-negotiable
- Dollar targets, not headcount targets
- Managers choose for their own teams
- Stay team one-on-ones are what create 2-week vs 60-day recovery
- Cut deep to cut once

**Red flags to watch for:**
- User planning email/Slack announcement (STOP)
- User wants to skip stay team one-on-ones (challenge strongly)
- User cutting by headcount not dollars (redirect)
- User spreading cuts over multiple rounds (consolidate if possible)
- User not prepared to be transparent about financials (prepare them)

**Limitations and edge cases:**
- Legal requirements vary by country/state (get legal counsel)
- WARN Act in US requires 60-day notice for large layoffs
- Union environments have different requirements
- Some countries make layoffs very difficult (may need different approach)
- Public companies have disclosure requirements
