- **Company Stage**: All stages
- **Difficulty**: Intermediate

## Overview
When you join a team or need to drive change, you must diagnose what's actually missing before prescribing solutions. The Managing Complex Change framework identifies five components required for successful change: **Vision, Skills, Incentives, Resources, and Action Plan**. The key insight: **missing any single component produces a predictable failure mode that helps you diagnose what to fix**.

## When to Use
- Joining a new team as a leader
- Driving organizational change
- Team not executing effectively
- Cultural transformation needed
- Diagnosing team dysfunction
- Planning a transformation initiative

## Prerequisites
- Observation time with the team
- Access to team members across functions
- Ability to influence the missing components
- Leadership support for changes

## Core Concept: Five Components of Change

### The Five Required Components

**1. Vision**
- Clear picture of where the team is going
- Shared understanding of success
- Why the change matters
- Inspiring and believable direction

**2. Skills**
- Capabilities needed to execute
- Technical and functional abilities
- Mental models and frameworks
- Knowledge and experience

**3. Incentives**
- Motivation to do the work
- Alignment of personal and team goals
- Recognition and rewards
- Career advancement connection

**4. Resources**
- People, budget, tools
- Time and bandwidth
- Cross-functional support
- Authority and permissions

**5. Action Plan**
- Clear next steps
- Defined responsibilities
- Timeline and milestones
- Communication and coordination

### Missing Component → Predictable Failure

| Missing Component | Result |
|-------------------|--------|
| Vision | Confusion |
| Skills | Anxiety |
| Incentives | Resistance |
| Resources | Frustration |
| Action Plan | False starts |

**Diagnostic power:**
When you observe a specific failure mode, you know which component to address.

## Procedure

### Step 1: Observe the Team
Spend time understanding current state before acting.

**Observation methods:**
- Sit in team meetings silently
- Talk to people across functions
- Review recent work and decisions
- Watch how decisions get made
- Note what conversations come up repeatedly

**What to look for:**
- How aligned is the team on direction?
- What skills seem missing or weak?
- How motivated are people?
- What resource constraints come up?
- How clear are next steps after meetings?

**Key principle:**
> "I go and I sit in team meetings and see how they operate. I just listen. I talk to not only the PMs but the content designer and everyone."

### Step 2: Diagnose the Failure Mode
Match observed symptoms to missing components.

**Diagnosis guide:**

**Confusion symptoms (Missing Vision):**
- "What are we even trying to do?"
- Conflicting priorities across team members
- Work that doesn't connect to outcomes
- People pulling in different directions
- Debates about fundamental direction

**Anxiety symptoms (Missing Skills):**
- "I don't know how to do this"
- Work product quality issues
- Avoidance of certain tasks
- Over-reliance on specific people
- Requests for excessive guidance

**Resistance symptoms (Missing Incentives):**
- "Why should I care about this?"
- Passive agreement, no follow-through
- Politics and turf protection
- People protecting old ways
- Low energy and engagement

**Frustration symptoms (Missing Resources):**
- "We don't have what we need"
- Constant firefighting
- Burnout and overwhelm
- Quality sacrificed for speed
- Dependencies blocking progress

**False starts symptoms (Missing Action Plan):**
- "We keep starting but not finishing"
- Same discussions repeated
- Unclear ownership
- Missed deadlines
- Coordination failures

### Step 3: Prioritize What to Fix
Not all components are equally easy to change.

**Ease of change (easier to harder):**
1. Action Plan (most tactical, quickest wins)
2. Resources (if you have authority)
3. Incentives (requires organizational support)
4. Skills (takes time to build)
5. Vision (hardest, but most fundamental)

**Common approach:**
- Start with Action Plan fixes for quick wins
- Build credibility to address harder components
- Skills and Vision require sustained investment

**Warning:**
> "It's a lot harder to change vision and skills. It will come in time."

### Step 4: Address Missing Vision
Create clarity about direction.

**Vision-building activities:**
- Develop and communicate product strategy
- Create visual artifacts (wireframes, roadmaps)
- Align on success metrics
- Share context from leadership
- Connect work to company mission

**Vision template:**
> "We are building [what] for [whom] to enable [outcome]. Success looks like [metrics]. This matters because [why]."

### Step 5: Address Missing Skills
Build team capabilities.

**Skills-building approaches:**
- Training and education
- Mentorship programs
- Documentation and playbooks
- Hiring for gaps
- Pairing and knowledge transfer

**Example (Product Craft):**
> "My teams didn't have a mental model for product craft. So I had to build a deck that showed, okay, here's how I think about product craft. Here's a framework for it."

**Create shared language:**
- Build a deck of frameworks and mental models
- Establish common vocabulary
- Share examples of good and bad
- Review work against standards

### Step 6: Address Missing Incentives
Align motivation with goals.

**Incentive alignment:**
- Connect work to career growth
- Recognize and celebrate contributions
- Ensure fair compensation
- Remove perverse incentives
- Make success visible

**Check alignment:**
- Are teams incentivized for their piece or the whole?
- Does individual success require team success?
- Are short-term metrics undermining long-term goals?
- Is the right behavior being recognized?

### Step 7: Address Missing Resources
Get teams what they need.

**Resource advocacy:**
- Staff the team appropriately
- Secure budget and tools
- Remove dependencies
- Protect team time
- Grant necessary authority

**Resource gaps:**
- Identify specific blockers
- Quantify impact of gaps
- Make business case to leadership
- Prioritize resource requests

### Step 8: Address Missing Action Plan
Create clarity about next steps.

**Action plan components:**
- PRD frameworks and templates
- Meeting structures and cadences
- Decision-making processes
- Communication protocols
- Review and feedback loops

**Tactical wins:**
- Implement good meeting hygiene
- Create clear ownership for initiatives
- Establish regular check-ins
- Document decisions and next steps
- Build accountability mechanisms

## Application Example: Joining a New Team

**Week 1-2: Observe**
- Sit in team meetings
- Talk to every team member
- Review recent work
- Note repeated conversations
- Identify failure mode symptoms

**Week 3-4: Diagnose**
- Match symptoms to missing components
- Validate diagnosis with key people
- Prioritize what to address
- Build relationships while observing

**Month 2-3: Address tactical gaps**
- Fix Action Plan issues (easy wins)
- Address obvious Resource gaps
- Build credibility through improvement

**Month 3-6: Address deeper gaps**
- Build Skills through training/frameworks
- Align Incentives with leadership
- Develop and communicate Vision

## Expected Outcomes
- Accurate diagnosis of team issues
- Targeted interventions vs. guessing
- Faster team improvement
- Sustained behavior change
- Reduced dysfunction recurrence

## Common Pitfalls

### Jumping to solutions without diagnosis
- "We need to reorganize"
- "We need better tools"
- May address wrong component
- Diagnose first, then prescribe

### Addressing only easy components
- Fix Action Plan but ignore Skills
- Team still can't execute well
- Must address all gaps eventually
- Easy wins aren't enough alone

### Trying to fix everything at once
- Overwhelming change
- Nothing done well
- Prioritize and sequence
- Build on small wins

### Ignoring resistance (Incentives)
- "They'll come around"
- Change without buy-in fails
- Address why people resist
- Align incentives explicitly

### Not building Skills
- Expect instant capability
- "Just do it better"
- Skills take time to build
- Invest in training and frameworks

- Team Onboarding
- Organizational Design

## AI Integration Notes

### Context signals that should trigger this SOP:
- "Team not executing"
- "I'm joining a new team"
- "Need to drive change"
- "Team dysfunction"

### How to apply:
- Observe and identify symptoms
- Diagnose missing component
- Recommend targeted interventions
- Sequence by ease of change

### Key insight:
When change fails, it's usually because a specific component is missing, not because "the team is bad" or "change is hard." Diagnose the missing component through its symptoms (Confusion → Vision, Anxiety → Skills, Resistance → Incentives, Frustration → Resources, False starts → Action Plan) and address that specifically.
