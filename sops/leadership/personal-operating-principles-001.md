- **Company Stage**: All stages
- **Difficulty**: Beginner to Intermediate

## Overview
Personal Operating Principles are the explicit beliefs and behaviors that guide how you work and lead. They help you understand yourself, communicate your style to others, and make consistent decisions. The key insight: **self-awareness to build mutual awareness is the most fundamental thing you need to crack if you're going to succeed at company building or management**.

## When to Use
- Starting a new leadership role
- Building trust with a new team
- Unclear about your leadership style
- Feeling inconsistent in your approach
- Onboarding direct reports
- Creating your "Working with Me" document

## Prerequisites
- Willingness to self-reflect
- Openness to feedback
- Time for introspection

## Core Concept: Claire's Four Operating Principles

### 1. Build Self-Awareness to Build Mutual Awareness
**Meaning**: Understand yourself first, then share that understanding with others.

**Why it matters:**
- You can't lead others if you don't understand yourself
- Exposing your motivators, blind spots, and tendencies helps others work with you
- Creates psychological safety through vulnerability

**Strong opinion strongly held**:
> "The more that you can seek feedback, seek to understand your motivators, your strengths, your blind spots, your tendencies, and take that on board and expose it to others, you're going to be a much more effective company builder and manager."

### 2. Say the Thing You Think You Cannot Say
**Meaning**: Surface uncomfortable truths in a non-threatening way.

**Why it matters:**
- Often your biggest strength is something you don't realize
- Unspoken disagreements are more dangerous than spoken ones
- Others are probably thinking the same thing but afraid to speak

**Techniques to detoxify the left-hand column:**
1. **Ask a question**: "Is there something we're not talking about?"
2. **Own it**: "I feel like..." or "I wonder if..."
3. **Avoid judgment**: Make an observation, not an accusation

**Example**: "I feel like there's something we're not talking about, and I wonder if it's the fact that these two teams both seem to have the exact same project."

### 3. Distinguish Between Management and Leadership
**Meaning**: Understand that management and leadership require different skills and mindsets.

**Management**:
- Enabling people to do their best work
- Creating environment and context
- Coaching and developing

**Leadership**:
- Setting vision and direction
- Inspiring and motivating
- Making strategic decisions

**Reid Hoffman's self-assessment**:
> "I'm more of a leader. I'm not a manager. I wouldn't hire me to manage a McDonald's."

### 4. Come Back to the Operating System
**Meaning**: In chaos, return to your rituals and common practices.

**Why it matters:**
- Chaos is inevitable in high-growth environments
- Stability comes from consistent practices
- Operating systems prevent reinventing the wheel

**How it works:**
> "When all the other stuff is going haywire — you've got a customer churning, a big launch happening — come back. What's our launch process? We have a way of doing that. We do not need to spin out of control."

## Procedure: Developing Your Operating Principles

### Step 1: Identify Your Core Values
Use a values clarification exercise.

**Process:**
1. Get a list of 70-80 values (find online)
2. Pick 10 that matter most
3. Narrow to 5
4. Force yourself to pick 3

**Values examples:**
- Family
- Ambition
- Impact
- Competition
- Education
- Integrity
- Transparency

### Step 2: Find the Story Behind Each Value
Each value has a formative experience that made it important.

**Claire's example (from her team):**
- Eli valued transparency extremely highly
- He would tell his team everything, even unfinished plans
- The reason: His mother was sick when he was 7-8 and no one told him what was happening
- She died, and he found out at a lunch with his stepfather
- Transparency became core to who he is

**Prompt**: For each value, ask "What happened in my life that made this so important?"

### Step 3: Assess Your Work Style
Take multiple assessments and look for patterns.

**Assessments to consider:**
- Myers-Briggs
- DISC
- Enneagram
- StrengthsFinder

**Key dimensions:**
1. Introvert ←→ Extrovert
2. Task-oriented ←→ People-oriented

**Grid interpretation:**
| | Task | People |
|---|---|---|
| Extrovert | Director (get it done) | Charismatic (sell vision) |
| Introvert | Analyst (deep work) | Supporter (build relationships) |

### Step 4: Synthesize Into Principles
Combine values + work style into actionable principles.

**Format**: [Principle name]: [What it means in practice]

**Examples:**
- "Say the thing you think you cannot say": I will surface uncomfortable truths, framed as questions or observations
- "Explore, don't lecture": In coaching, I ask questions rather than give answers

### Step 5: Test and Refine
Share with trusted colleagues and iterate.

**Questions to ask:**
- "Does this resonate with how you experience me?"
- "What am I missing?"
- "Are there behaviors I exhibit that don't match these principles?"

### Step 6: Document and Share
Create a "Working with Me" document.

**Contents:**
- Your operating principles
- Your work style preferences
- How to give you feedback
- Common misunderstandings about you
- What you're working on improving

## The "Explorer, Not Lecturer" Coaching Framework

### The Mistake Most Managers Make
Thinking the job is to be the expert and tell people what to do.

**Claire's view:**
> "Your job is to enable people to be their very damn best on your team."

### Hypothesis-Based Coaching
Use intuition to form a hypothesis, then explore it with the person.

**Scientific approach:**
1. Observe a pattern (intuition)
2. Form a hypothesis about what's happening
3. Explore with the person (don't declare)
4. Adjust based on their response

**Example conversation:**
- "How did you feel that presentation went?"
- "It's fine. I got through the material."
- "I felt like you were maybe a little bit nervous. I'm just exploring. Were you...?"
- "What do you mean?"
- "My experience of you in that meeting was that you seemed nervous. Your leg was shaking, you were repeating yourself."

**Key**: You're holding up a mirror, not passing judgment.

### Physical Tells to Notice
People often don't know what they're doing.

**Example**:
> "When they're getting uncomfortable in a meeting, they push their chair back from the table, exit the circle. That is a very physically big statement. And they had no idea. What I need to explore is how do you vocalize that instead of physically exiting the room?"

## Expected Outcomes
- Clearer self-understanding
- Better communication with teams
- More consistent leadership
- Faster trust-building
- Improved coaching effectiveness

## Common Pitfalls

### Skipping the stories
- Values without context are abstract
- The stories make them real and memorable
- Share your stories with your team

### Principles that sound good but aren't true
- Don't write aspirational principles
- Write what's actually true about how you operate
- Test with people who know you

### Not updating principles over time
- You will change
- Revisit annually
- Add what you're working on improving

### Keeping principles private
- The whole point is mutual awareness
- Share with your team
- Use them in onboarding

## AI Integration Notes

### Context signals that should trigger this SOP:
- User mentions "leadership style," "working with me"
- New manager role
- Team communication issues
- Self-awareness questions

### How to apply:
- Start with values exercise
- Emphasize finding the stories
- Encourage documentation and sharing
- Connect to company operating system

### Key insight:
Self-awareness isn't navel-gazing — it's the foundation for effective leadership. You can't build mutual awareness without first understanding yourself.
