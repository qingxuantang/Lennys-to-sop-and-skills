## Overview
A first-principles approach to building platform businesses that focuses on merchant/user empowerment over value extraction, complexity reduction over feature accumulation, and long-term positioning over short-term monetization. This framework prioritizes being a foundation that "pushes from behind" rather than controlling the narrative.

## When to Use
- When designing initial platform business model and positioning
- When deciding between marketplace control vs. merchant independence
- When evaluating feature requests that add complexity
- When considering monetization or pricing changes
- When product complexity is causing user churn
- When making trade-offs between short-term revenue and long-term position

## Prerequisites
- Clear mission focused on user empowerment (not platform aggrandizement)
- Willingness to sacrifice credit/visibility for user success
- Understanding of path dependence in your industry
- Commitment to measuring impact on user success, not just platform metrics
- Acceptance that reducing complexity may mean saying "no" to revenue opportunities

## Procedure

### Step 1: Choose Empowerment Over Control
Make foundational business model choice:
- **Platform approach**: Help people build their own things they own
- **Marketplace approach**: Lease components at prices that correspond to user margins
- Ask: "Do we want to be written into their success story, or push from behind?"
- Shopify choice: "We don't want the credit... We want to just have you do your thing"

**Key insight**: "Pushing from behind" creates more durable moats than controlling the narrative

### Step 2: Derive Solutions from First Principles
When approaching platform features:
- Study existing solutions in your space - what exists and why?
- Identify path dependencies: What compromises were made based on old constraints?
- Ask: "How would we solve this problem given every fundamental building block available RIGHT NOW?"
- Understand "power and composability" of current building blocks
- Don't skip straight to "good version of what everyone else does"

**Red flag**: Any proposal that is "same thing everyone else does" - that's product leadership abdication

### Step 3: Optimize for First-Time Entrepreneurs
Design for unsophisticated, scared users (not experts):
- Most valuable market: People who can spend lunch breaks building a business
- These users are: Unsophisticated, don't know what to do, scared, getting discouragement from others
- Create software "so intuitive that frustrated people in dead-end careers" can make progress
- Don't overfit to enterprise RFP processes (that's procurement theater)

**Strategic advantage**: Software that works for beginners scales UP to enterprise better than enterprise software scales DOWN

### Step 4: Treat Complexity as a Moral Issue
Reduce complexity whenever possible:
- "When software goes bad, it makes people feel dumb"
- "Machines do not get to negatively influence people" - this is moral obligation
- Every time you make complex thing simpler, MORE businesses will exist on your platform
- Bad UX causes businesses to fail: "Fuck it, I'm not cut out for this"
- The person who quits wasn't necessarily unqualified - they hit a complexity barrier

**Measurement**: Lowering complexity directly causes more entrepreneurship (validated through Shopify data)

### Step 5: Take Over Complexity, Don't Expose It
For platform components users struggle with:
- Tax configuration: Don't create configuration screen - just make it correct automatically
- Payments: Abstract away API complexity
- Fraud: Handle it behind the scenes
- Let software "overtake this piece of complexity" users don't need to think about

**Example**: "There's basically no tax configuration screen. It's just correct. We know what the taxes are everywhere."

### Step 6: Measure Impact on User Success, Not Platform Vanity
Track what matters to users:
- Not: Number of businesses on platform
- Yes: Number of businesses that succeeded BECAUSE of platform
- Track businesses that "got very close to quitting many times" but were saved by better UX
- Understand: "It is not just businesses that shouldn't exist anyway that stop" at complexity barriers

**Discovery**: "Every single time we make a complex thing simpler, more businesses exist on platform"

### Step 7: Avoid Monetization Lever-Pulling
Manage monetization strategically:
- Create as many monetization levers as possible
- Then don't pull them (or pull minimally)
- "I would leave Shopify if that happens to me, so how is that good?"
- Resist "enormous pricing power" advice from bankers
- Revenue model: "Very, very small stake of sales" - incentivized to make everyone successful

**Mindset**: You're on same side of table as customers, not extracting from them

### Step 8: Play Long-Term Iterated Prisoner's Dilemma
For partnerships and ecosystem:
- Every interaction is iterated prisoner's dilemma: Coordinate or defect
- Short-term: Defection when partner coordinates yields one-time gain
- Long-term: Continuous coordination yields exponentially more value
- Example: Stripe + Shopify partnership assuming both would win their markets

**Discipline required**: Corporate marshmallow test - turn away from short-term gains

### Step 9: Build for the Internet of the Future
Future-cast your platform design:
- Don't optimize for existing retail porting complex businesses online
- Optimize for making it "easier to start new businesses online than in physical world"
- Remove barriers from physical world (leases, upfront costs, regulations)
- Ask: What will e-commerce/your domain look like in 10-20 years?

**Path to enterprise**: Solving for future (simpler, internet-native) actually prepares you for enterprise better

### Step 10: Accept Being Different as Strategic Advantage
Embrace being the contrarian platform:
- You will violate conventional platform/marketplace playbooks
- "Talking about fun sounds naive" while "metrics sound sophisticated"
- Most alpha is in "things that are unobvious but true"
- "If you want to do something world-class, you can't do it like everyone else"

**Axiom**: "If you want to do something better than what exists, you have to do it differently"

## Expected Outcomes
- More businesses start and succeed on your platform (core metric)
- Deeper merchant/user loyalty ("want more from you, not less")
- Sustainable competitive moat from trust and empowerment
- Platform becomes "part of a team" not "tool in toolbox, usually forgotten"
- Merchants ask platform to "subsume all other software spend"
- Long-term value compounds as position strengthens
- Ecosystem partners coordinate rather than defect

## Common Pitfalls
- **Mistaking simplicity for lack of power**: Simple UX can tame enormous complexity
- **Adding features to win RFPs**: Enterprise software overfits to sales process, not user success
- **Pulling monetization levers too early**: Extracting value before position is strong hollows out platform
- **Measuring vanity metrics**: Businesses on platform ≠ businesses successful because of platform
- **Optimizing for existing market**: Current users' complex needs may not represent future opportunity
- **Taking credit**: Wanting to be in the merchant's success story undermines empowerment positioning
- **Death by a thousand good decisions**: Path dependence means "only making good choices" can still lead to local maxima
- **Ignoring the courage barrier**: UX that works for courageous people won't scale to most users

## AI Integration Notes
Context signals that should trigger this SOP:
- Platform vs. marketplace business model decisions
- Questions about simplifying complex workflows
- Monetization or pricing strategy discussions
- Feature requests that add complexity
- Concerns about competitive feature parity
- Debates about merchant/user control vs. platform optimization

How to adapt for different situations:
- **Two-sided marketplaces**: Balance empowerment of both sides; usually favor supply side (creators/sellers)
- **Developer platforms**: Complexity tolerance higher but "pit of success" principles still apply
- **Enterprise platforms**: Still optimize for simple, then scale up; don't start with complexity
- **Consumer platforms**: Complexity tolerance near zero; ruthlessly simplify
- **Regulated platforms**: Find where to hide compliance complexity from users

Limitations and edge cases:
- Some businesses require complexity (financial services, healthcare); question is WHERE complexity lives
- Not all platforms can avoid value extraction (e.g., ad-supported models)
- May require patient capital; shorter time horizons force monetization lever-pulling
- Empowerment model harder in winner-take-all markets
- May sacrifice short-term growth for long-term position

Examples and case studies:
- **Tax configuration**: No configuration screen - Shopify just knows taxes everywhere
- **First entrepreneur optimization**: "Frustrated people in dead-end careers can spend lunch breaks building business"
- **Stripe partnership**: Both small companies, assumed both would win, coordinated continuously
- **Remote work pivot**: When Boolean of "can people leave house" flipped, reran entire decision tree
- **Not optimizing for RFPs**: Enterprise software overfits to feature checkboxes, not actual quality
- **Pricing power rejection**: Investment bankers suggest aggressive pricing; Tobi rejects because "I'd leave if that happened to me"
- **Complexity = business death**: Every simplification leads to measurably more successful businesses

Key philosophical foundations:
- **Path dependence**: All existing solutions are highly path-dependent; question old constraints
- **Courage as bottleneck**: Most people aren't limited by intelligence but by courage; lower courage requirement
- **Goodhart's Law = Overfitting**: "Any metric that becomes a goal ceases to be a good metric"
- **Axiom of differentiation**: Can't create something better by doing same thing
- **Corporate marshmallow test**: Long-term platforms must resist short-term value extraction
