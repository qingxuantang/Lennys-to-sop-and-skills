## Metadata
- **Source**: Petra Wille - Lenny's Podcast
- **Domain**: Leadership & Product Management
- **Type**: Framework + Assessment Tool
- **Applicable To**: Product Managers (self-assessment), Product Leads (coaching), HR (leveling)
- **Difficulty**: Beginner to Intermediate

## Overview
The PMwheel is an assessment framework that evaluates product managers across eight distinct capability areas. Unlike T-shaped models, it recognizes that PMs need to be "eight-legged creatures" with competencies spanning the entire product lifecycle plus team dynamics, personal growth, and agile foundations.

## When to Use
- When starting coaching conversations with a new PM
- When a PM feels stuck and doesn't know where to improve
- When creating individual development plans
- When you need to assess a PM's capabilities holistically
- During hiring to identify skill gaps
- When building PM career ladders or leveling guides
- At the start of a performance review cycle

## Prerequisites
- 30-60 minutes for self-assessment
- Honest self-reflection mindset
- Basic familiarity with product management practices
- Ideally, 3 perspectives: self-assessment, manager assessment, peer/team assessment

## Procedure

### Step 1: Conduct Self-Assessment
**Time Required**: 45-60 minutes

1. Download or create PMwheel assessment (15 questions per bucket = ~120 questions)
2. Find quiet, reflective space
3. Answer honestly using rating scale (typically 1-5 or 1-10)
4. For each bucket, note:
   - Current strength areas
   - Clear gaps or weaknesses
   - Examples that demonstrate your level
5. Don't overthink - first instinct is often most accurate

**Rating Scale Suggestion:**
- 1-2: Beginner - Limited knowledge/experience
- 3-4: Developing - Some experience, inconsistent application
- 5-6: Proficient - Regular, confident application
- 7-8: Advanced - Can teach others, adapt to complex situations
- 9-10: Expert - Recognized authority, innovative applications

### Step 2: Gather Manager Assessment
**Time Required**: 30-45 minutes (for manager)

1. Share blank PMwheel with your manager
2. Ask them to assess you across the same buckets
3. Request specific examples where possible
4. Schedule follow-up conversation to discuss

**Manager Tips:**
- Be honest but constructive
- Focus on observable behaviors
- Provide specific examples for low and high ratings
- Consider their role context (technical PM vs. consumer PM, etc.)

### Step 3: Collect Peer/Team Feedback (Optional but Valuable)
**Time Required**: 20-30 minutes per person

1. Select 2-4 people who work closely with you:
   - Engineering partners
   - Design partners
   - Other PMs
   - Cross-functional stakeholders
2. Ask them to assess specific buckets where they have visibility
   - Engineers: "Get It Done", "Team", "Iterate"
   - Designers: "Understand Problems", "Find Solutions", "Team"
   - Data analysts: "Listen and Learn", "Iterate"
3. Focus on their direct experience with you

**Why Different Perspectives Matter**:
- You may rate yourself low on "Understand Problems" but users rave about your empathy
- Manager sees strategic thinking, team sees execution
- Blind spots are revealed through gaps between self and others' views

### Step 4: Synthesize Results
**Time Required**: 30-45 minutes

1. Create visual representation:
   - Spider/radar chart showing all eight buckets
   - Overlay self vs. manager vs. peer assessments
2. Identify patterns:
   - **Strengths**: High ratings across multiple perspectives
   - **Blind spots**: Self-rated high, others rate low
   - **Hidden strengths**: Self-rated low, others rate high
   - **Development areas**: Consistently low ratings
3. Look for the story:
   - Is there a progression pattern (strong on early buckets, weak on later ones)?
   - Are "soft skills" (Team) lagging "hard skills" (Planning)?
   - Does your profile match your role needs?

### Step 5: Prioritize Development Areas
**Time Required**: 15-30 minutes

1. Don't try to fix everything at once
2. Use this prioritization framework:
   - **Impact**: Which gaps are blocking your effectiveness most?
   - **Role alignment**: Which are most critical for your current/next role?
   - **Improvability**: Which can you realistically develop in 3-6 months?
   - **Energy**: Which are you genuinely interested in improving?
3. Select 1-2 buckets to focus on for the next quarter
4. Within those buckets, identify 2-3 specific capabilities

**Example**:
- Focus Bucket: "Listen and Learn"
- Specific Capabilities: A/B test interpretation, qualitative research synthesis
- Why: Currently making gut decisions, need to be more data-informed for senior PM promotion

### Step 6: Create Development Plan
Feed directly into Step 4 of Five-Ingredient Coaching Framework.

1. For each focus area, define:
   - Current state (with examples)
   - Desired state (with success criteria)
   - Learning actions (books, courses, practice opportunities)
   - Timeline (3-4 months typically)
2. Share with manager
3. Set up accountability/follow-up

## Expected Outcomes
- **Comprehensive view** of PM capabilities across all dimensions
- **Multi-perspective insights** revealing blind spots and hidden strengths
- **Prioritized development** focus instead of scattered improvement attempts
- **Productive coaching conversations** grounded in specific, observable capabilities
- **Shared language** between PM and manager about what "good" looks like
- **Career clarity** about gaps between current state and next level

## Common Pitfalls

**Pitfall 1: Copy-Paste Assessment Without Customization**
- **Mistake**: Using PMwheel questions exactly as written for a highly technical PM role vs. consumer PM role
- **Solution**: Adapt questions to your context. Technical PMs may need different "Understand Problems" questions than B2C PMs.

**Pitfall 2: Only Doing Self-Assessment**
- **Mistake**: Relying solely on your own perception of your capabilities
- **Solution**: Always get at least one other perspective (manager minimum, ideally team members too). Blind spots are called blind spots for a reason.

**Pitfall 3: Trying to Improve All Eight Buckets Simultaneously**
- **Mistake**: Creating development plan that addresses weaknesses in every bucket
- **Solution**: Pick 1-2 buckets per quarter. Depth beats breadth in skill development.

**Pitfall 4: Confusing PMwheel with Career Levels**
- **Mistake**: Thinking "I need to be 10/10 in all buckets to be senior PM"
- **Solution**: PMwheel shows capabilities, not levels. Different roles need different profiles. A technical PM might be 9/10 in "Get It Done" and 6/10 in "Understand Problems" - that's fine for their role.

**Pitfall 5: Ignoring "Personal Growth" Bucket**
- **Mistake**: Skipping this bucket because it's not about product craft
- **Solution**: This bucket is intentionally on the wheel to make development part of every conversation. Without growth mindset, other buckets won't improve.

**Pitfall 6: Using PMwheel Only Once**
- **Mistake**: Doing assessment once and never revisiting
- **Solution**: Reassess every 6-12 months to track growth and recalibrate focus areas.

**Pitfall 7: Not Preparing for the Assessment**
- **Mistake**: Trying to assess while distracted or rushed
- **Solution**: Block dedicated time, bring examples from recent work, reflect deeply.

## AI Integration Notes

### Context Signals
Recommend PMwheel when detecting:
- Questions about: "PM assessment", "what makes a good PM", "how to evaluate PMs", "PM skills"
- User mentions: "stuck in my development", "don't know what to improve", "360 review coming up"
- Coaching context: "new direct report", "need to assess team", "career development"

### Adaptation Guidance
- **For self-assessment**: Emphasize honest reflection, getting other perspectives, prioritizing 1-2 buckets
- **For managers assessing PMs**: Focus on observable behaviors, specific examples, constructive framing
- **For hiring**: Use to identify specific skill gaps, not as pass/fail filter
- **For career conversations**: Map current PMwheel profile to next-level requirements

### Output Formats
When recommending PMwheel, AI should:
1. First understand user's context (role, experience, goal)
2. Suggest which buckets are most relevant to their situation
3. Offer to help prioritize development areas after assessment
4. Connect to development planning resources
5. Provide context-specific question examples

### Limitations
- Not a performance review tool (it's developmental, not evaluative)
- Doesn't replace domain-specific assessments (growth PM needs growth-specific eval)
- Cultural context matters (some questions may need adaptation for non-Western contexts)
- Self-assessment accuracy varies widely (some people over/under-rate themselves)
- Requires PM domain knowledge to assess accurately (not suitable for non-PM managers without guidance)

### Integration with Other Frameworks
When PMwheel is invoked, consider also surfacing:
- Marty Cagan's PM Assessment (alternative/complementary framework)
- PM Daisy (another alternative)
- Company-specific career ladders (to map PMwheel results to levels)
- Five-Ingredient Coaching Framework (next step after assessment)
