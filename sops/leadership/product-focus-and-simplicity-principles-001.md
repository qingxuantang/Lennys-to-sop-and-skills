## Overview
A framework for maintaining product focus and solving meaningful problems at their highest level of abstraction. This SOP addresses the challenge of companies launching multiple products that dilute focus, create organizational tension, and make them vulnerable to platform competitors. Based on Dropbox's journey from simple file syncing to multiple product lines and back to focused problem-solving.

## When to Use
- Company is spreading across multiple product lines with different customer personas
- Product portfolio creates organizational conflicts over resource allocation
- Competing with platform companies that can bundle and give away products for free
- Product strategy lacks clarity about core value proposition
- Different products serve fundamentally different customer needs (consumer vs. enterprise)
- Team is confused about priorities and what to build next
- Launching products that "everybody else would've invented 10 minutes later"

## Prerequisites
- Understanding of your core customer base and what they actually pay for
- Analysis of which products/features drive revenue vs. usage
- Honest assessment of organizational capacity and execution capability
- Clarity on competitive landscape and platform risks
- Willingness to sunset products to achieve focus

## Procedure

### Step 1: Define the Problem at the Highest Level of Abstraction
Identify the fundamental job-to-be-done, not the implementation:
- **Look beyond the immediate solution**: "I wasn't really [solving] thumb drive... the real issue is that it's super hard to find my stuff, organize my stuff, share my stuff, and secure my stuff"
- **Recognize the problem persists across contexts**: "In the beginning that was my stuff was my files, and the scattering was across devices. Now, the stuff is tabs in my browser, and cloud tools"
- **Focus on timeless human needs**: The specific technology changes, but fundamental human problems remain
- **Ask "what job is this really doing?"**: Move up the abstraction ladder from features to needs

**Example evolution**:
- Surface level: "Sync files across devices"
- Mid level: "Access my files anywhere"
- Highest level: "Find, organize, share, and secure my stuff"

### Step 2: Evaluate Multi-Product Portfolio for Coherence
Assess whether your product portfolio creates synergy or conflict:
- **Identify persona conflicts**: "The ideal file server replacement for an IT admin is going to look quite different from the ideal consumer photo sharing app"
- **Map revenue sources**: Understand which products actually drive monetization (e.g., "80% of people paying for Dropbox were using it at work")
- **Assess strategic vulnerability**: Are you competing in markets where platform companies can bundle for free?
- **Examine organizational strain**: Does maintaining multiple products create internal confusion and resource conflicts?

**Red flags**:
- Different products need fundamentally different features
- Sales/marketing struggles to explain what the company does
- Internal teams fighting over shared resources
- Products serve contradictory needs (privacy vs. sharing, simplicity vs. power)

### Step 3: Apply the "Platform Competition" Test
Evaluate each product against platform bundling risk:
- **Can platforms bundle this for free?** "They gave you free unlimited storage for life. They just totally nuked our business model"
- **Is this core to their platform?** Products that extend platform capabilities (photos, email) are high-risk
- **Do they have natural distribution advantages?** "When you turn on your iPhone for the first time, it's probably not going to give you an ad for Dropbox"
- **Can you realistically compete on economics?** Platforms often subsidize adjacent products with core business profits

**Evaluate each product**:
- Photo sharing → High risk (Google Photos, iCloud, Facebook all have strategic reasons to offer free)
- Email client → High risk (Gmail, Apple Mail control the platforms)
- File sync/collaboration → Medium risk but defensible with enterprise focus

### Step 4: Identify "Timeless" vs. "Temporary" Advantages
Distinguish durable value from easily-copied features:
- **Temporary**: UI innovations, specific features, storage capacity
  - "The UI, it's not a durable source of advantage. Gmail and Apple Mail are just going to have these swipes and snoozes"
- **Timeless**: Network effects, workflow integration, enterprise features, trust
  - Enterprise admin capabilities, compliance, workflow integration
- **Ask**: "Would we have invented this if [competitor] hadn't?" If no, it's likely not defensible

**Decision framework**:
- If competitive advantage is temporary → High risk of commoditization
- If core to platform player → Exit or pivot
- If durable advantage possible → Double down

### Step 5: Make the "Focus" Decision
Decide what to keep, what to kill, and what to integrate:
- **Follow the revenue**: "80% of people paying for Dropbox were using it at work"
- **Choose one clear direction**: "Killed Carousel, killed Mailbox, went all in on productivity"
- **Accept the loss**: "That meant foreclosing on photo sharing and consumer and storage and all these things that Dropbox had become synonymous with"
- **Communicate the why clearly**: Help team understand strategic reasoning, not just the decision

**Integration principle**: Can the product be integrated into core offering rather than separate app?
- Separate app → Usually introduces complexity and confusion
- Integrated feature → Enhances core value proposition

### Step 6: Solve Problems That Don't Solve Themselves
Focus on problems the market isn't adequately addressing:
- **Avoid obvious next features**: "We should probably not do things that would've been invented by everybody else 10 minutes later"
- **Look for systemic problems**: "This problem of being on this treadmill... everybody is on the same treadmill"
- **Find what competitors miss**: "None of our competitors even are framing the problem correctly"
- **Target non-renewable resources**: "Our ultimate non-renewable resource is our time, our attention, mostly our brain power"

**Example - The "enlightened work" problem**:
- Obvious: Add more collaboration features (everyone is doing this)
- Non-obvious: Solve the fundamental problem that "tools went from helping us get the work done to becoming the work"

### Step 7: Maintain Simplicity Through Evolution
As you add capabilities, preserve core simplicity:
- **Universal search over multiple search boxes**: "Why do I have 1 search box at home, and 10 search boxes at work?"
- **Unified experience over fragmented tools**: Connect disparate systems rather than add to fragmentation
- **Smart organization over manual filing**: "Organize your working life for you" rather than more folders
- **Problem-centric over tool-centric**: Organize around jobs-to-be-done, not applications

**Design principle**: Each new capability should reduce complexity, not add to it.

### Step 8: Rebuild from Core Problem Definition
Use crisis or pivot as opportunity to return to fundamentals:
- **Restate the mission**: "Dropbox is designing a more enlightened way of working"
- **Reconnect to original insight**: Return to the core problem that motivated founding
- **Evolve the expression**: Same fundamental problem, new technological context
- **Give team clear purpose**: "The thing they really want is a great experience"

**Product evolution should**:
- Address the same core human need
- Use new technologies to solve it better
- Maintain focus on that fundamental problem
- Avoid feature bloat and scope creep

## Expected Outcomes
- Clear, defensible product strategy focused on where you can lead
- Organizational alignment around priorities and resource allocation
- Reduced vulnerability to platform competition through strategic focus
- Improved execution velocity from reduced fragmentation
- Clearer value proposition for customers and market
- Product roadmap that builds on durable advantages

## Common Pitfalls
- **"Instagram syndrome"**: Believing every new product might be the next big thing
- **Sunk cost fallacy**: Continuing to invest in products because you've already invested so much
- **Revenue distraction**: Keeping products that generate some revenue but lack strategic defensibility
- **Failing to communicate "why"**: Team needs to understand strategic reasoning, not just decisions
- **Death by a thousand features**: Adding features to match competitors rather than solving core problems better
- **Ignoring platform risk**: Underestimating how quickly platforms can copy and bundle
- **Losing sight of fundamentals**: Getting distracted by shiny new technologies vs. timeless human problems
- **Product complexity creep**: Each product adds exponentially to organizational complexity

## AI Integration Notes
Context signals that should trigger this SOP:
- User struggling with multi-product strategy decisions
- Questions about product portfolio management
- Concerns about competing with platform companies
- Uncertainty about what makes their product defensible
- Team confusion about priorities and what to build
- Discussion of product focus vs. diversification

How to adapt for different situations:
- Early-stage: Focus on problem definition before building multiple products
- Growth-stage: Apply when considering expansion into adjacent markets
- Mature companies: Use for portfolio rationalization and refocusing
- B2C vs. B2B: Platform risk dynamics differ significantly

Limitations and edge cases:
- Some companies successfully maintain multiple products (requires exceptional resources)
- Market position matters—leaders can sustain broader portfolios than challengers
- Platform risk varies by product category and competitive dynamics
- Consumer vs. enterprise dynamics change the calculus significantly
- Some products have natural synergies that justify portfolio breadth
