## Overview
A framework for determining when and how to conduct skip-level meetings (meetings with people two or more levels below you in the organization) without undermining your direct reports' authority or creating unsustainable meeting loads. This SOP helps leaders balance staying connected with the organization while respecting the management chain.

## When to Use
- When you're promoted to a role managing managers
- When designing communication cadences for your organization
- When you feel disconnected from work happening two+ levels down
- When deciding whether to meet directly with individual contributors
- When your team raises concerns about you being too hands-off or too hands-on

## Prerequisites
- You manage at least one layer of managers (you're a manager of managers)
- You have established regular 1:1s with your direct reports
- You understand the risks of undermining your managers' authority
- You're clear on what information you actually need at your level

## Procedure

### Step 1: Define Your Information Needs
Clarify what you actually need to know versus what you're curious about.

**Critical Information for Senior Leaders**:
- Systemic issues affecting multiple teams (not isolated incidents)
- Cultural or morale patterns across the organization
- Gaps in communication or alignment between teams
- Early signals of management problems with your direct reports
- Technical or strategic blockers that need your level of intervention

**Information You Don't Need Directly**:
- Day-to-day technical decisions
- Individual performance issues (unless crisis-level)
- Tactical execution details
- One-off complaints or concerns that should be handled by direct managers

**Key Question**: "Will this information change a decision I need to make, or am I just satisfying curiosity?"

### Step 2: Establish the Default Communication Pattern
Set up your baseline communication structure before adding skip-levels.

**Foundation Layer (Non-Negotiable)**:
- **Weekly or biweekly 1:1s with direct reports**: Your managers are your primary information source
- **Team meetings you attend**: Regular exposure to broader team dynamics
- **Written updates**: Ask for concise weekly/biweekly updates from managers on their teams

**Why This Matters**:
Skip-level meetings should supplement, not replace, your primary information channels through your direct reports. If you're relying on skip-levels for basic information, you have a management chain problem.

### Step 3: Choose Your Skip-Level Approach
Select the right pattern based on your organization size and goals.

**Option 1: Scheduled Rotating Skip-Levels**
- **When to use**: 30-100 people in your organization
- **Cadence**: Monthly or quarterly skip-levels, rotating through all ICs over time
- **Format**: 30-minute 1:1 conversations
- **Topics**: Career development, org feedback, "what should I know that I don't know?"

**Option 2: Team-Based Skip-Levels**
- **When to use**: Clear team structures, 50-200 people
- **Cadence**: Quarterly team sessions with each manager's team
- **Format**: 60-minute group discussion with manager present or absent (be intentional)
- **Topics**: Strategy updates, Q&A, feedback on org direction

**Option 3: Office Hours / Open-Door**
- **When to use**: Larger organizations (200+), or when you want accessibility without structure
- **Cadence**: Weekly or biweekly office hours
- **Format**: Anyone can sign up for 15-30 minutes
- **Topics**: Anything they want to discuss

**Option 4: Targeted Skip-Levels for Specific Purposes**
- **When to use**: When investigating a specific issue or making a specific decision
- **Cadence**: One-time or short-term series
- **Format**: 30-minute conversations with selected ICs
- **Topics**: "I'm evaluating our hiring process—tell me about your experience"

### Step 4: Set Clear Expectations and Boundaries
Communicate the purpose and scope of skip-levels to avoid undermining your managers.

**What to Communicate to Your Managers**:
- **Purpose**: "I'm doing skip-levels to stay connected and spot patterns, not to manage around you"
- **Frequency**: "I'll meet with each IC once a quarter"
- **Topics**: "I'll focus on career development and organizational feedback, not day-to-day work"
- **Escalation protocol**: "If someone raises an issue with me, I'll loop you in before taking action"
- **Your commitment**: "I won't make decisions about your team without discussing it with you first"

**What to Communicate to ICs**:
- **Purpose**: "This is a chance for you to share feedback and ask questions about the broader org"
- **Confidentiality**: Be clear about what you can keep confidential vs. what you'll share with their manager
- **Not a backdoor**: "This isn't a way to go around your manager for approvals—if you have concerns about your manager, we'll discuss how to address that"
- **Topics welcome**: Career development, org feedback, strategic questions

### Step 5: Conduct Skip-Levels with the Right Focus
Run the actual meetings in a way that gathers valuable information without creating problems.

**Effective Skip-Level Question Framework**:

**Opening Questions (Build Rapport)**:
- "Tell me about what you're working on—what's interesting about it?"
- "How long have you been at [company]? What brought you here?"

**Organizational Health Questions**:
- "If you could change one thing about how we work, what would it be?"
- "What's something you wish leadership understood better?"
- "Are there blockers or inefficiencies you're seeing across teams?"
- "What should I know that I probably don't know?"

**Career Development Questions**:
- "Where do you want to be in 2-3 years?"
- "What kind of support or opportunities would help you grow?"
- "Is there anything about your role or team that's not aligned with your goals?"

**Manager Effectiveness (Use Carefully)**:
- "How's your relationship with [manager name]?"
- "Do you feel supported in your role?"
- "Are you getting the feedback and direction you need?"

**Questions to Avoid**:
- Detailed technical decisions their manager should own
- Direct requests for changes to team priorities (creates backdoor)
- Asking people to criticize their manager directly (creates awkwardness)

### Step 6: Process Information Without Undermining Managers
Handle what you learn in a way that strengthens your management chain.

**When You Hear Systemic Issues**:
- **Pattern**: Multiple ICs mention the same problem across teams
- **Action**: Raise with your managers as a group: "I'm hearing X from multiple teams—what are you all seeing?"
- **Don't**: Publicly attribute to specific ICs or create feeling that you're "checking up" on managers

**When You Hear Individual Manager Issues**:
- **Isolated concern**: One IC has concern about their manager
- **Action**: Ask: "Have you discussed this with [manager]?" → Coach them to address directly → Follow up with manager privately: "I want to make sure [IC] feels comfortable raising concerns with you"
- **Don't**: Jump in to "fix" the problem or share specifics without permission

**When You Hear Career Development Needs**:
- **Example**: IC wants to work on different type of project
- **Action**: Loop in their manager: "[IC] mentioned interest in X—wanted to make sure you're aware as you're planning their development"
- **Don't**: Promise opportunities or make commitments without manager involvement

**When You Hear Technical/Strategic Insights**:
- **Example**: IC has thoughtful perspective on technical direction
- **Action**: "That's a great point—have you shared this with [manager] or in [relevant forum]?" → If not, encourage them to do so
- **Don't**: Take the idea and run with it without involving the manager

### Step 7: Close the Feedback Loop
Ensure people see that skip-levels lead to meaningful action.

**After Each Round of Skip-Levels**:
1. **Synthesize themes**: What patterns emerged across conversations?
2. **Discuss with your managers**: Share aggregated feedback (not individual comments)
3. **Take visible action**: If you heard consistent themes, address them
4. **Communicate back**: In team meetings or org updates, mention: "Based on feedback I've been hearing, we're going to..."

**Why This Matters**:
If skip-levels feel like "black holes" where people share feedback and nothing changes, they'll stop being useful. People need to see that their input influences decisions.

### Step 8: Continuously Evaluate the ROI
Skip-levels take significant time—make sure they're worth it.

**Quarterly Assessment Questions**:
- Am I learning things I wouldn't learn through my managers?
- Are these meetings strengthening or weakening my managers' authority?
- Am I taking meaningful action based on what I learn?
- Could I get this information another way (surveys, group forums, manager updates)?
- Are people finding these meetings valuable or are they just tolerating them?

**Red Flags to Stop or Adjust**:
- ICs are using skip-levels to bypass their managers for approvals
- Your managers feel undermined or don't know what you're hearing
- You're spending 20% of your time on skip-levels with minimal insight
- Issues raised in skip-levels should have been surfaced by managers (communication problem)

## Expected Outcomes
- **Pattern Recognition**: You spot systemic issues earlier across teams
- **Cultural Awareness**: You maintain connection to organizational culture and morale
- **Manager Development**: You identify where managers need coaching or support
- **Employee Voice**: ICs feel they have access to senior leadership
- **Stronger Management Chain**: Done well, skip-levels strengthen (not weaken) manager relationships

## Common Pitfalls

### Pitfall 1: Using Skip-Levels to Micromanage
**Problem**: Diving into tactical details that managers should own, undermining their authority.

**How to Avoid**:
- If you find yourself wanting to give specific direction, stop and ask: "Why isn't their manager handling this?"
- Redirect tactical questions: "That's a great question for [manager]—have you discussed?"
- Focus on patterns and strategy, not individual decisions

### Pitfall 2: Creating a Backdoor Around Managers
**Problem**: ICs learn they can get decisions by coming to you instead of their manager.

**How to Avoid**:
- Never approve requests in skip-levels without manager involvement
- Explicitly say: "That's something to discuss with [manager]—let's loop them in"
- If someone is consistently trying to bypass their manager, that's a coaching issue for the manager or a performance issue for the IC

### Pitfall 3: Breaking Confidentiality Inappropriately
**Problem**: Sharing specific feedback with managers in a way that burns trust with ICs.

**How to Avoid**:
- Be clear upfront: "I may share themes with your manager, but I won't attribute specific comments without asking you first"
- Ask permission: "This is important—would it be okay if I discussed this with [manager]?"
- Use aggregated feedback: "I'm hearing from multiple people that..." vs. "[Name] told me that..."

### Pitfall 4: Skip-Levels as Theater
**Problem**: Doing skip-levels because "good leaders do them" without clear purpose or follow-through.

**How to Avoid**:
- Define specific goals before starting skip-levels
- Track what you learn and what action you take
- If you're not learning anything useful after 2-3 rounds, stop or redesign

### Pitfall 5: Overwhelming Your Calendar
**Problem**: Committing to skip-levels with 50+ ICs on a recurring basis.

**How to Avoid**:
- Do the math: 50 quarterly skip-levels = 4 per week every week
- Consider group formats, office hours, or rotating schedules
- Accept that you can't have deep relationships with everyone—focus on systemic insight

### Pitfall 6: Not Involving Managers in the Process
**Problem**: Surprising your managers with skip-level learnings they knew nothing about.

**How to Avoid**:
- Tell your managers before scheduling skip-levels
- Optionally: Have managers suggest topics or ICs to talk to
- Debrief with managers after each round
- Never let managers be surprised by org changes based on skip-level feedback

## Advanced Techniques

### Technique 1: The "Shadow" Skip-Level
**Setup**: Invite the direct manager to join the skip-level meeting as an observer.

**When to Use**:
- When coaching a new manager
- When addressing manager trust issues
- When the topic is career development (manager should hear directly)

**Benefits**:
- Builds manager's skills in 1:1 conversations
- Creates transparency
- Strengthens relationships rather than creating competing channels

### Technique 2: Themed Skip-Level Rounds
**Setup**: Each quarter, focus skip-levels on a specific theme.

**Examples**:
- Q1: Technical debt and infrastructure feedback
- Q2: Career development and growth paths
- Q3: Cross-team collaboration pain points
- Q4: Organizational strategy and direction

**Benefits**:
- Gives skip-levels clear purpose
- Allows you to go deeper on specific topics
- Creates more actionable outputs

### Technique 3: The Pre-Decision Skip-Level
**Setup**: Before making major organizational decisions, conduct targeted skip-levels.

**Example**: "We're considering reorganizing around product lines—I want to understand how this might affect teams."

**Benefits**:
- Better decisions based on ground truth
- Builds buy-in by involving people early
- Surfaces unintended consequences

## AI Integration Notes

**Context Signals That Should Trigger This SOP**:
- User asks about skip-level meeting best practices
- User is promoted to director or VP level
- User mentions feeling disconnected from their organization
- User is concerned about undermining their managers
- User asks how to stay technical/connected as they scale

**How to Adapt for Different Situations**:
- **For new directors**: Emphasize starting conservatively and building trust with managers first
- **For VPs of large orgs (500+)**: Focus on group formats and office hours over 1:1s
- **For high-trust environments**: Can be more informal and frequent
- **For low-trust or political environments**: Require more structure and transparency
- **For remote orgs**: Consider async options (AMAs, written Q&A) alongside synchronous skip-levels

**Limitations and Edge Cases**:
- Some company cultures discourage skip-levels (respect local norms)
- Early-stage startups may not need formalized skip-levels
- Crisis situations may require temporary increases in skip-level communication
- Some managers may be insecure about skip-levels regardless of execution (may need coaching)
