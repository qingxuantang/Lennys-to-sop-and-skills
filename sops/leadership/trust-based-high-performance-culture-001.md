- **Difficulty**: Advanced

## Overview
A framework for building a high-trust, high-performance culture that maximizes human potential through radical belief in people's capabilities, direct feedback, compressed decision cycles, and tolerance for unquantifiable quality. This creates an environment where courage is valued over conformity and disagreement builds trust.

## When to Use
- When building company culture from scratch or evolving existing culture
- When hiring leaders who will shape organizational norms
- When team performance plateaus despite talented people
- When politics or consensus-seeking slows decision-making
- When feedback culture is too gentle to drive real growth
- When people optimize for convenience over conviction

## Prerequisites
- Leadership conviction that people are far below their maximum potential
- Willingness to hold extremely high standards while supporting growth
- Comfort with discomfort (yours and others')
- Ability to model the behaviors you want to see
- Ready to be "harder on yourself than on anyone else"
- Understanding that this culture won't work for everyone (and that's okay)

## Procedure

### Step 1: Establish the Foundational Belief
Internalize and communicate core conviction:
- "There is not a single person on this planet who is even close to being at their maximum potential"
- People are "way, way, way, way, way better than they think"
- The gap between current and potential performance comes from:
  - Ideas about cultivation of skills not yet discovered
  - Environment that narrows focus to unambitious things
  - Competition with everyone else on safe, conventional goals

**Action**: Explicitly communicate this belief and reference it when giving feedback

### Step 2: Implement "Compression of Time" for Decisions
Compress change management into shorter timeframes:
- When you see something wrong, have the conversation immediately
- Update your priors quickly based on new information
- Don't let projects languish if they're not going to work
- Frame it as: "It's super unfair to let people work on something that isn't going to make it"
- Accept that rapid pivots feel "whiplashy" but are respectful of people's time

**The "Tobi Tornado" Principle**: Whole lot of change/conversation/conflict compressed into very short timeframe

### Step 3: Give Feedback That Holds People to Their Potential
Deliver direct, high-standard feedback:
- Point out when someone chose convenience over conviction (path B over path A)
- Say: "I expected better of you because you probably saw this fairly early"
- Frame as: "I think you had it in you to do this significantly better"
- Make clear you're disappointed they didn't live up to their own standards, not yours
- Hard to hear because "it's right" - that's what makes it valuable

**Key distinction**: Hold people accountable to their actual potential, not their current level "plus a little bit extra"

### Step 4: Make Disagreement the Path to Trust
Actively invite and reward disagreement:
- "I immediately love it" when someone disagrees
- It requires courage (the rarest thing in the industry)
- Shows they'll do what's right rather than what's convenient
- Immediately stop and explore: "Cool, let's figure out why there's disagreement"
- Look for unstated foundational assumptions causing divergence

**Cultural norm**: Disagreement builds trust rather than threatening it

### Step 5: Play Devil's Advocate to Prevent Groupthink
When consensus emerges too easily:
- If proposal feels predictable with nothing surprising, challenge it
- "Make myself an end boss of a level" by saying "this is just not that good"
- Force team to argue more deeply for their convictions
- Use this to practice decision-making together as a team
- Goal: Ensure decisions are conviction-based, not comfort-based

### Step 6: Value Courage Over Intelligence
Shift what you select for:
- "I found a lot more high IQ in industry than courage"
- "I found a lot more maybe even genius than courage"
- Look for people who disagree with the group when they think something is wrong
- Recognize that courage is what enables people to reach their potential
- Create safety for courageous acts (disagreement, ambitious proposals, admitting mistakes)

### Step 7: Embrace the Unquantifiable
Build acceptance for non-metric-driven decisions:
- Most valuable things are unquantifiable: fun, delight, taste, quality, passion
- "If all the metrics are pointing down but everyone says 'I'm having so much more fun,' metrics will start going up"
- Be "extremely data-informed" but don't use KPIs/OKRs as goals (Goodhart's Law)
- Make edits to business that don't remind people of metric-driven companies they came from
- Data as "cockpit for a pilot" - decisions still made by people

**Rationale**: Overlap of "most valuable things" and "fully quantifiable things" is only ~20%

### Step 8: Create "Finite, Winnable Games" Within Infinite Game
Balance mission focus with achievable goals:
- Founders/leadership focus on infinite game (mission that outlasts careers)
- Create clear, winnable objectives for teams that serve the infinite game
- Give people games they can win and feel proud of
- These finite games should explore "parts of the map" toward mission
- Prevents despair from only having 100-year goals

### Step 9: Optimize for Pride and "Giving a Shit"
Make quality intrinsically motivated:
- "Quality of a product is simply a reflection of how much the people who created it gave a shit"
- Product leader's role: Make sure the team gives a shit
- Build empathy for users, but also be infectious with your own care
- "It is not possible to make great products if people do not give a shit"
- Deep satisfaction of craftsperson doing job well is better proxy than metrics

### Step 10: Accept That This Is "Terrible Place to Work" for Many
Embrace cultural selectivity:
- "Terrible place to work for many, many, many people"
- "Best place in the world to work for some people"
- This is good - people should "window-shop for a place where they can be enormously successful"
- Find people for whom "the place's set of beliefs just fits you like a glove"
- Don't try to be for everyone

## Expected Outcomes
- Team members accomplishing things they "didn't imagine they could"
- Faster decision cycles and less organizational politics
- Higher product quality from intrinsic motivation
- Stronger conviction in decisions (less hedging)
- More courage in product bets and strategic choices
- People who stay become enormously successful
- Culture of "wanting to be at their maximum potential"
- Looking back on career: "Holy shit, we shipped this thing... at a company full of people who cared as much as I did"

## Common Pitfalls
- **Becoming a tyrant**: High standards without genuine belief in people becomes toxic; must be paired with support
- **Forgetting self-application**: Being "harder on yourself than anyone else" is essential; otherwise seems hypocritical
- **Mistaking harshness for directness**: Feedback should be about potential, not punishment
- **Insufficiently explaining "why"**: Tobi Tornado fails if people don't understand the reasoning
- **Not creating safety**: Disagreement only works if people trust they won't be punished for it
- **Expecting universal fit**: Trying to make culture work for everyone dilutes what makes it powerful
- **Ignoring the human cost**: Compression and high standards are exhausting; need sustainable pace

## AI Integration Notes
Context signals that should trigger this SOP:
- Questions about building high-performance culture
- Issues with feedback culture being too soft or political
- Teams underperforming despite talented individuals
- Discussions about setting standards or expectations
- Questions about when to kill projects or change direction
- Concerns about consensus-driven decision-making

How to adapt for different situations:
- **Early-stage startups**: Easier to establish from day one; bake into first hires
- **Scaling companies**: Requires intentional culture preservation as you grow
- **Established companies shifting culture**: Hardest scenario; requires modeling from top and patience
- **Remote companies**: Compression of time may need to be balanced with async communication
- **Regulated industries**: High standards still apply, but decision compression may face constraints

Limitations and edge cases:
- Requires founder/CEO with deep conviction and willingness to model it
- Can be misinterpreted as lack of empathy if not executed with genuine care
- May struggle in cultures where indirect communication is norm
- Turnover may be higher as people self-select out
- Can be exhausting to maintain; requires sustainable practices
- Doesn't work if leadership isn't willing to change their own minds
- May conflict with HR/legal advice about feedback practices

Examples and case studies:
- **Project cancellation**: Tobi entering chat to end project immediately vs. letting it die slowly over months
- **Monorepo decision**: Using technical depth to make call that compresses debate, "Tobi said so helps"
- **Remote work shift**: When foundational Boolean changed, rerunning entire decision tree quickly
- **Disagreement building trust**: Immediately loving when someone disagrees; stopping to explore assumptions
- **Hackathon participation**: Tobi coding alongside engineers till 1 AM demonstrates hands-on engagement
- **Investment banker pricing pitch**: Rejecting aggressive pricing because "I'd leave Shopify if that happened to me"
