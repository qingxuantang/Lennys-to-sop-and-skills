- **Applicable To**: Product leaders, PMs in large companies, innovation team leads
- **Difficulty**: Advanced

## Overview
A framework for successfully launching new products within established companies, based on building multiple billion-dollar businesses at Facebook (Marketplace, mobile direct response ads, mobile ad network). Addresses the unique challenges of innovation inside large organizations where resources are scarce, scrutiny is high, and failure rates are 50%+.

## When to Use
- When tasked with building something new (0-to-1) at an established company
- When launching innovation initiatives or incubation teams
- When considering whether to work on core product vs. new initiatives
- When new products are struggling to gain traction or resources
- When deciding portfolio strategy between incremental and breakthrough innovation

## Prerequisites
- Experience in the core business (understand how company operates)
- High risk tolerance (50%+ failure rate for new products)
- Resilience to handle multiple pivots and near-death experiences
- Understanding of company's resource allocation and decision processes
- Ability to work with minimal resources and attention

## Procedure

### Step 1: Choose Your Battle (Zig When Others Zag)
Identify opportunities where:
- **Less competition internally**: Core products attract top talent; new areas have less
- **Leverage existing strengths**: Use company assets (platform, users, relationships) as advantage
- **Under-the-radar potential**: Not sexy enough for high scrutiny, but has real potential

Deb's examples:
- Payments → Games (leveraged payment relationships with game companies)
- Games relationships → Mobile ads (asked game companies what they needed)
- Platform team → First mobile direct response ad product (not even on ads team)

**Anti-pattern**: Don't compete head-on with core product teams for resources and talent.

### Step 2: Set Expectations (Yours and Others')
Understand the reality:
- **Very high failure rate**: Even successful companies have ~50% hit rate on new products
- **Minimal resources**: Seeds get scattered, not focused cultivation
- **Low attention**: You're not the most important thing (and that's good)
- **Long iteration cycles**: Multiple pivots before success (Deb tested 5-6 versions before breakthrough)

For yourself: "Do I have resilience for this?" Many PMs want new things but can't handle failure.

For stakeholders: "We're experimenting. Give us space to fail and iterate."

### Step 3: Operate Under the Radar (Love to Death Problem)
Actively avoid excessive attention:
- **Don't ask for too many resources** (small team is better than big, scrutinized team)
- **Minimize check-ins** (week-to-week scrutiny kills iteration speed)
- **Work on multiple bets** (if one is failing, have backup plan)

Key insight: "You can love something to death" - large companies kill products with attention.

Deb's example: When ads product was struggling, she took her old job back (running payments) while keeping small team working on ads. This bought time for iteration without being cut.

**The freedom to fail is more valuable than abundant resources.**

### Step 4: Rapid Iteration (Fail Fast or Succeed Fast)
Structure for speed:
- **Test multiple versions quickly** (Deb tried 5-6 ad formats)
- **Prune ruthlessly**: If it's not working, move to next variant
- **Small team, fast decisions**: Avoid consensus paralysis
- **Leverage existing infrastructure**: Don't rebuild from scratch

Avoid: "The long slog" - products that don't fail or succeed just consume resources and eventually get cut.

### Step 5: Find Your Alpha Customer
Leverage company relationships:
- **Who already trusts the company?** (Deb: game companies from payments work)
- **Who has urgent pain?** (Game companies needed mobile acquisition during mobile shift)
- **Who will give honest feedback?** (Partners with existing relationships)

Build the product they explicitly ask for, not what you think they need.

Deb's mobile ads success: Game companies said, "Build us a mobile acquisition engine." They built exactly that.

### Step 6: Portfolio Strategy (Have Multiple Jobs)
Risk mitigation approaches:
- **Keep a core role while experimenting** (Deb ran payments + ads simultaneously)
- **Work on multiple seeds** (not all eggs in one basket)
- **Move between impact and learning**: Go back to core product if new thing isn't working

This is career risk management, not lack of commitment.

### Step 7: Prove Value Before Asking for Resources
Traction sequence:
1. Start with minimal team (can be 2-3 people)
2. Ship first version quickly
3. Get initial traction (usage, revenue, whatever matters)
4. Use data to request more resources
5. Repeat

**Don't ask for resources based on potential. Ask based on proven momentum.**

### Step 8: Know When to Persevere vs. Pivot
Pivot signals:
- No user engagement after multiple versions
- Fundamental assumptions proven wrong
- Market isn't ready (but might be later)

Persevere signals:
- One version shows promise (even small)
- Customer demand is clear
- Technical feasibility is proven

Deb's ads product: "On the verge of death multiple times" but kept finding new angles.

### Step 9: Scale Only After Product-Market Fit
Premature scaling kills innovation:
- **Wait for signal**: Clear user love, retention, engagement, or revenue
- **Then add resources**: Team, infrastructure, support
- **Avoid**: Building big team before proving concept

In large companies, once you scale, expectations change. You're now measured like core products.

### Step 10: Transition from Innovation to Growth
When product works:
- **Formalize team structure**: Move from scrappy to sustainable
- **Build systems**: Processes, reporting, roadmaps
- **Hire for scale**: Different people needed for 0→1 vs. 1→100
- **Accept scrutiny**: You're now important enough to matter

Many 0→1 leaders struggle with this transition. That's okay - different skills needed.

## Expected Outcomes

### For the Product:
- Higher success rate than pure startups (leverage company assets)
- Faster initial traction (existing user base, distribution)
- Sustainable business line if successful
- Potential billion-dollar business within 18-24 months (Deb's mobile ads)

### For Your Career:
- Distinctive achievements ("I built X from zero")
- Broad skillset (vs. optimizing core metrics)
- Resilience and adaptability
- Higher risk but higher potential reward

### For the Company:
- Portfolio diversification
- Retention of entrepreneurial talent
- New revenue/value streams
- Competitive moat expansion

## Common Pitfalls

### Pitfall 1: Wanting Resources Before Traction
**Problem**: "We need 20 engineers to test this idea."

**Solution**: Start with 2-3 people. Prove value. Then ask for resources. Large teams create pressure for premature success.

### Pitfall 2: Too Much Scrutiny Too Early
**Problem**: Leadership wants weekly updates, strategy reviews, roadmap presentations while you're still iterating.

**Solution**: Actively manage up. "Give us a quarter to experiment. We'll report back with learnings." Protect the space to fail.

### Pitfall 3: Competing with Core Product
**Problem**: Asking for engineers working on the main revenue driver.

**Solution**: Find slack resources, underutilized platforms, or build complementary (not competitive) products.

### Pitfall 4: Building for Yourself (Customer of One)
**Problem**: "I love eBay so I know what to build."

**Solution**: That gets you in the door, but then talk to real customers, cohorts, segments. Deb fell in love with the problem, not her solution.

### Pitfall 5: Not Knowing When to Quit
**Problem**: Iterating forever with no signal of success.

**Solution**: Set kill criteria upfront. "If we don't see X metric by Y date, we stop." Be honest about signals.

### Pitfall 6: Perfectionism in Iteration
**Problem**: Spending 6 months on version 1 instead of testing 6 versions in 6 months.

**Solution**: Embrace scrappy. Ship, learn, pivot. Speed is survival.

### Pitfall 7: Wrong People for Stage
**Problem**: Hiring people who need structure, process, and stability for 0→1 work.

**Solution**: For early stage, hire people comfortable with ambiguity, chaos, and potential failure.

## Career Advice: Should You Do This?

### Good Fit If You:
- Have 2-3+ years experience (learned core PM skills)
- Are ready for "big swing" in career
- Can handle failure (it will happen)
- Enjoy ambiguity and building from scratch
- Are at a point where you can take career risk

### Not Good Fit If You:
- Early career (learn core skills first in stable product)
- Need steady upward trajectory
- Uncomfortable with high failure probability
- Prefer optimization to creation
- Risk-averse or need immediate validation

### Timing in Career:
- **Years 0-3**: Build core skills on stable products
- **Years 3-7**: Consider "big swing" on 0→1 (have skills, can take risk)
- **Years 7+**: Either you love this and do it repeatedly, or you move to core/scale roles

## AI Integration Notes

### Context Signals That Should Trigger This SOP
- User works at large/established company and wants to build something new
- Innovation team struggling to gain traction or resources
- Questions about whether to join 0→1 vs. core product team
- New product facing scrutiny or resource constraints
- Career decision about taking innovation role

### How to Adapt for Different Situations

**By Company Stage:**
- **Small startup (0-50 people)**: Less relevant - whole company is 0→1
- **Growth stage (50-500)**: Some principles apply but resources more available
- **Large (500+)**: Full framework applies - politics, resource scarcity, scrutiny
- **Giant (5000+)**: Even more critical - bureaucracy, internal competition

**By Product Type:**
- **Platform product**: Easier to stay under radar, harder to show traction
- **Consumer product**: Easier to show usage metrics, harder to get distribution
- **B2B product**: Easier to find alpha customers, longer sales cycles
- **Infrastructure**: Hardest to show value early, most patience required

**By Industry:**
- **Tech**: Framework designed for this, applies directly
- **Enterprise**: Longer cycles, more process-heavy, need executive sponsor earlier
- **Consumer**: Higher failure rates, need faster iteration

**By Role:**
- **IC PM**: Focus on execution, rapid iteration, proving value
- **PM Lead**: Portfolio strategy, protecting team from scrutiny
- **Executive**: Enabling environment, patience, knowing when to cut vs. fund

### Limitations and Edge Cases
- Some companies truly can't innovate internally (cut 0→1 efforts too fast)
- Regulated industries have different constraints (can't iterate freely)
- Some innovations require large upfront investment (hardware, infrastructure)
- Company culture matters enormously (Google's 20% time vs. Microsoft's historic challenges)

### Example Prompts for Application
- "I'm at a large company and want to build something new. Should I do it?"
- "My innovation project isn't getting resources. How do I navigate this?"
- "Should I join the core product team or the experimental team?"
- "We're getting too much scrutiny on our new product. How do we buy space to iterate?"
- "I've tried 3 versions of this product and nothing is working. Should I keep going?"
