## Overview
The Genie Framework is a career goal-setting methodology that helps you identify what you truly want to do with your life by removing the fear of failure from the equation. It's designed to surface your authentic career aspirations that may be buried under limiting beliefs, societal pressures, and practical concerns.

## When to Use
- You're facing a career decision and feel torn between options
- You know you're on autopilot but don't know what you really want
- You have multiple job offers and can't decide which aligns with your values
- You're at a career crossroads (post-MBA, promotion, job change, burnout)
- You're working on something you "should" do but feel no energy for it
- During annual career planning or major life transitions

## Prerequisites
- 30-60 minutes of uninterrupted time in a quiet space
- Willingness to be honest with yourself
- Paper/journal or digital document for writing
- Openness to considering non-traditional paths

## Procedure

### Step 1: Set Up the Thought Experiment
Position yourself mentally for the exercise:
- Find a quiet space where you won't be interrupted
- Clear your mind of immediate practical concerns
- Prepare to answer honestly, not "correctly"

**The Scenario**: Imagine you're walking home from work and see a bright, shiny object on the ground. You walk over and realize it's a magic lamp. You rub it and a genie appears.

The genie says: "I haven't been in this bottle for 10,000 years yet, so I'm not fully formed. I can't give you three wishes. But I can give you one wish: Whatever you throw yourself into with your whole life and your career, it's going to turn out great. It's probably going to take longer than you think. It's going to be harder than you think, but you're going to be really happy you did it, and it's going to work out beyond your wildest imagination."

### Step 2: Answer the Core Question
Write down your answer to: **"If you had this genie's blessing, what would you wish for?"**

Important guidelines:
- Don't self-censor based on practicality
- Don't worry about how you'd pay for it
- Don't limit yourself based on current skills or connections
- Focus on what makes your heart and energy come alive
- Write the first thing that comes to mind, then refine

Examples of genie goals:
- Starting a nonprofit in your home country to improve education access
- Buying and running companies in a specific industry you're passionate about
- Starting an amusement park
- Becoming a motivational speaker
- Building a specific product that solves a problem you care deeply about
- Creating educational content full-time

### Step 3: Identify Your Energy Source
Read your answer and check:
- Does this make you feel energized or drained?
- Is this what YOU want, or what you think you should want?
- Does this answer come from your "internal scorecard" or "external scorecard"?

**Internal scorecard**: What excites you, aligns with your values, makes you come alive
**External scorecard**: What looks good on paper, impresses others, follows the expected path

If your answer feels flat or obligatory, return to Step 2 and dig deeper.

### Step 4: Use Complementary Questions
If you're stuck, try these additional questions to unlock your genie goal:

1. **"If you didn't have to make money, what would you do?"**
   - Reveals what you genuinely enjoy

2. **"What's play for you that is work for other people?"** (Naval Ravikant)
   - Identifies your natural strengths and interests

3. **"What's the thing you really want to do, but you're too embarrassed to say?"**
   - Surfaces hidden dreams blocked by shame or fear of judgment

4. **"Who are some people you admire and want to be more like, and what do they do?"**
   - Reveals role models and potential paths

5. **"Five to ten years from now, you're amazing at X. What's X?"**
   - Helps you work backward from a future vision

### Step 5: Write Down All Limiting Beliefs
Once you have your genie goal, immediately write down every reason why you think you CAN'T or SHOULDN'T do it:

Examples:
- "I don't know how to start"
- "I have business school debt"
- "I don't have the right connections"
- "My family expects me to take the safe job"
- "I'm not qualified"
- "How would I get funding?"
- "I'm too old/young"
- "The market is too competitive"

**Critical insight**: These limiting beliefs are most powerful when they remain in your subconscious. Writing them down strips them of power.

### Step 6: Convert Limiting Beliefs to To-Do Items
Go through each limiting belief and reframe it as a solvable problem:

| Limiting Belief | Reframed as To-Do Item |
|----------------|------------------------|
| "I don't know how to get funding" | "Research nonprofit funding models; talk to 3 people who've done this" |
| "I have $100k in debt" | "Create 3-year financial plan; calculate what I need to earn while building" |
| "I don't have connections in this space" | "Join 2 industry groups; attend 1 conference; set up 5 informational interviews" |
| "I'm not qualified" | "Identify skill gaps; create learning plan; find mentors" |

### Step 7: Create Your Path Forward
Your genie goal doesn't have to start tomorrow. Instead:

1. **Acknowledge where you are**: "I'm in this job for the next 18 months to pay off debt"
2. **Define the bridge**: What can you do NOW to move toward your genie goal?
   - Spend 2 hours/week learning the industry
   - Start a side project related to your goal
   - Build relationships with people in that space
   - Create content or experiments in that domain
3. **Set a milestone**: When will you reassess and potentially make the leap?

The formula: **"You + excited about something + decade or more = Success"**

Missing ingredient for most people: **TIME**. Expect this to take 10-20 years, not 1-2 years.

### Step 8: Share and Create Accountability
- Tell at least one trusted person about your genie goal
- Find an accountability partner or coach
- Schedule monthly check-ins on progress toward your goal
- Put bridge activities on your calendar (they won't happen otherwise)

## Expected Outcomes
- Clear identification of what you truly want to do with your career
- Distinction between external pressures and internal desires
- List of specific, actionable obstacles (not vague fears)
- A path forward that acknowledges current constraints while moving toward your goal
- Increased energy and intentionality in your current work
- Foundation for making better career decisions aligned with your values

## Common Pitfalls

### Pitfall 1: Confusing the Genie Goal with a "Safe" Goal
**What it looks like**: Your answer is still what you think you "should" want
**How to avoid**: Notice your energy. If you don't feel excited or slightly scared, dig deeper

### Pitfall 2: Dismissing Your Goal as "Unrealistic"
**What it looks like**: You identify your real goal but immediately discount it as impossible
**How to avoid**: Remember - the genie guarantees you'll be happy you tried, not that it'll be easy. Most meaningful careers take 10-20 years to build.

### Pitfall 3: "Not Now" Syndrome
**What it looks like**: "This is my genie goal, but I'll start in 5 years when..."
**How to avoid**: It's never the right time. Start the journey in some small way NOW, even if you can't go full-time immediately.

### Pitfall 4: Staying in Your Head
**What it looks like**: Thinking about this exercise but never writing it down or talking about it
**How to avoid**: Writing activates more of your brain than thinking. Speaking activates even more. Do both.

### Pitfall 5: Optimizing for Tomorrow Instead of 5 Years from Now
**What it looks like**: Making decisions to avoid short-term discomfort rather than long-term fulfillment
**How to avoid**: Ask "What would my 5-year-future-self wish I did today?"

## AI Integration Notes

### Context Signals That Should Trigger This SOP
- User expresses feeling stuck or unfulfilled in career
- User asks "What should I do with my life?" or similar existential career question
- User mentions feeling on "autopilot"
- User has multiple options and is choosing based on external factors only
- User mentions following what they "should" do rather than what they want
- User asks about career transitions or major decisions

### How to Adapt for Different Situations
- **For junior professionals**: Emphasize that genie goals can evolve; this isn't a permanent commitment
- **For senior executives**: Focus on "What would you do if money weren't an issue?"
- **For founders already on a path**: Use this to validate they're on the right path or identify pivots
- **For people with financial constraints**: Emphasize the bridge strategy and long-term timeline

### Limitations and Edge Cases
- Not suitable for immediate tactical career decisions (which job offer to take next week)
- Requires psychological safety - some users may not be ready to be honest with themselves
- Cultural contexts may make some genie goals more difficult (family expectations, visa constraints)
- Should be combined with practical financial planning, not replace it
- Works best when paired with accountability mechanisms (coach, peer group)

### Follow-Up Questions to Ask
1. "What did you notice about your energy when you wrote that down?"
2. "Is this your answer or is this what you think you should say?"
3. "What's the scariest part of pursuing this?"
4. "What's one small thing you could do this week to move toward this?"
5. "Who's one person who's done something similar that you could learn from?"
