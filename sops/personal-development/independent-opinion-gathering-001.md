- **Applicable To**: Leaders, Product Managers, anyone facilitating decisions
- **Company Stage**: All stages
- **Difficulty**: Beginner

## Overview
The most impactful improvement you can make to organizational decision-making is to gather opinions independently before group discussion. This eliminates groupthink, prevents anchoring to the loudest voice, and surfaces the true spread of perspectives. The core insight: **Discover → Discuss → Decide** — but only the "Discuss" part should happen in the meeting.

## When to Use
- Any group decision or planning session
- Brainstorming new ideas
- Forecasting timelines or outcomes
- Prioritization exercises
- Roadmap planning
- Hiring decisions
- Investment decisions

## Prerequisites
- A decision or topic requiring group input
- Ability to collect input asynchronously (forms, docs, etc.)
- Willingness to restructure how meetings work

## Core Concept: Separate Discover, Discuss, Decide

**Traditional meeting** (problematic):
1. Discover: "What does everyone think?" → People share opinions in room
2. Discuss: Debate and discussion
3. Decide: Vote or decide together

**Problems:**
- First opinions anchor the group
- Loudest/most confident person dominates
- Disagreement surfaces inadequately
- True diversity of thought is hidden
- Junior people defer to senior
- Groupthink emerges

**Better approach:**
1. **Discover** → BEFORE the meeting, independently
2. **Discuss** → IN the meeting (the only thing that happens there)
3. **Decide** → AFTER the meeting, often by DRI

## Procedure

### Step 1: Define What You Need to Discover

Before the meeting, identify:
- What opinions, judgments, or forecasts do I need?
- What questions should each person answer?
- What format should responses take?

**Examples:**
- Roadmap: "Force rank these 10 features with rationale"
- Timeline: "Estimate how many sprints, with upper/lower bounds"
- Hiring: "Score this candidate 1-5 on each criterion with notes"
- Strategy: "What are the top 3 risks with this approach?"

### Step 2: Collect Input Independently

**Tools:**
- Google Forms (dumps to private spreadsheet)
- Airtable or Coda with hidden responses
- Simple email with "reply only to me"
- Shared doc where people can't see others' responses

**Instructions to participants:**
- "Reply only to me, not reply-all"
- "Don't discuss with others before submitting"
- "Include your rationale for each response"

**Critical**: No one should see others' answers before submitting their own.

### Step 3: Aggregate and Analyze Before Meeting

**What to look for:**
- Where is there strong agreement? (spend less meeting time)
- Where is there disagreement? (focus meeting discussion)
- Are there outliers with interesting rationales?
- Any surprising perspectives?

**Prepare for discussion:**
- Compile all responses (anonymized or attributed as appropriate)
- Highlight areas of disagreement
- Send compiled responses to everyone before meeting

### Step 4: Structure the Discussion

**In the meeting:**
- Start with the areas of disagreement
- For each topic: have person share their view, then reflect back

**Facilitator says:**
> "So what I heard you say is [restatement]. Is that right?"

**No evaluation language:**
- Never say "I agree" or "I disagree"
- Never say "You're wrong"
- Never interrupt
- Just listen and reflect back

**Go around for each disagreement:**
- Everyone gets to share their perspective
- Clarifying questions only
- No debate during sharing

### Step 5: Discuss the Disagreements

**After everyone has shared:**
- Now open for discussion
- Focus on understanding, not winning
- "I'm curious about..." not "I think you're wrong because..."

**Key principle**: Goal is NOT alignment or agreement. Goal is understanding.

### Step 6: Decide (Often After Meeting)

**Best approach: Single decision maker (DRI)**
- One person makes the call, informed by discussion
- "Nevertheless, this is what we're doing"

**If group decision required:**
- Collect votes independently (same as Step 2)
- Private voting prevents anchoring

**Alignment is NOT the goal:**
> "The word alignment is stupid and shouldn't be used. You have 10 people in a room who are all really different. They're never going to agree, and it's really bad if the expectation is that they're supposed to."

### Step 7: Communicate the Decision

After deciding:
- Share the decision with full group
- Explain the rationale
- Acknowledge disagreement existed
- Commit to the path forward

**Nevertheless language:**
> "I heard everyone's input. The perspectives on [X] were particularly valuable. Nevertheless, we're going with [decision] because [rationale]."

## Why This Works

**Psychological effects:**
- Equal voice regardless of seniority
- Permission to disagree
- Reduced groupthink
- True diversity of thought surfaces
- People feel heard even when decision doesn't go their way
- Higher ownership of decision (paradoxically)

**Information effects:**
- See the full spread of opinions
- Outlier perspectives are captured
- Rationales help identify why people think what they think
- Discussion time focused on actual disagreements

## Example: Product Roadmap Prioritization

**Before meeting (Discover):**
1. Send list of 15 potential features
2. Ask each PM to force-rank 1-15
3. Require 3-sentence rationale for top 5 and bottom 5
4. Deadline: 24 hours before meeting

**In meeting (Discuss):**
1. Show compiled rankings
2. Identify where rankings diverge most
3. For each area of disagreement:
   - Person who ranked it highest explains why
   - Person who ranked it lowest explains why
   - Others can ask clarifying questions
4. Open discussion on key trade-offs

**After meeting (Decide):**
1. Product Lead reviews all input
2. Makes final prioritization decision
3. Shares decision with rationale to team

## Expected Outcomes
- More diverse perspectives surface
- Junior people's opinions are heard
- Better decisions through information aggregation
- Higher commitment even from those who disagreed
- Reduced political dynamics
- Faster meetings (discussion is focused)

## Common Pitfalls

### Letting discovery happen in the room
- Once one person speaks, others anchor
- You'll never know what people really thought
- Always collect independently first

### Expecting agreement/alignment
- Agreement is not realistic
- Seeking it creates coercion
- Accept disagreement, make a call

### Evaluating during sharing
- "I agree" or "I disagree" shuts people down
- Just reflect back and clarify
- Evaluation comes in discussion phase

### Not having a decision maker
- Endless discussion without decision
- Someone must own the call
- "Nevertheless" closes the loop

## AI Integration Notes

### Context signals that should trigger this SOP:
- User mentions "getting buy-in," "team decision"
- Questions about brainstorming or prioritization
- Concerns about groupthink
- Dominant personalities in meetings

### How to apply:
- Help design the independent collection (what questions to ask)
- Suggest tools for anonymous collection
- Provide facilitation language for discussion
- Remind about "nevertheless" closing

### Key insight:
The simple act of gathering opinions independently before discussion is perhaps the highest-ROI decision improvement you can make.
