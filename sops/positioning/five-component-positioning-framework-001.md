- **Company Type**: B2B Tech (primary), adaptable to others
- **Difficulty**: Intermediate

## Overview
Positioning defines how your product is the best in the world at delivering value that a well-defined set of customers care about. This framework provides a systematic approach to defining positioning through five interconnected components, executed in a specific sequence for maximum clarity.

## When to Use
- Your sales calls frequently result in confusion or "pitch it again"
- Customers compare you to wrong competitors
- Marketing and sales are telling different stories
- You're growing and need to align new team members
- Entering a new market segment
- After significant product or market changes
- Before major marketing/sales investment

## Prerequisites
- Existing customers (at least a handful)
- Access to sales calls or customer feedback
- Cross-functional team availability (marketing, sales, product, CEO)

## Procedure

### Step 1: Identify Competitive Alternatives
**What do you have to beat to win a deal?**

**Two categories to consider:**

1. **Status quo**: Whatever they're doing now (spreadsheets, manual process, interns)
   - 40% of B2B deals lost to "no decision" = lost to status quo

2. **Short list alternatives**: Other solutions they'll evaluate

**Don't limit to "products like yours"** - include:
- Different approaches to the same problem
- Workarounds and manual processes
- "Do nothing" option

**Output**: List of 3-5 key competitive alternatives

### Step 2: Document Differentiated Capabilities
**What do you have that alternatives don't?**

Once you have competitive alternatives defined, list:
- Features the alternatives lack
- Capabilities unique to your company (pricing, services, expertise)
- Technical advantages
- Approach differences

**Key principle**: Only list things that are TRUE differentiators vs. the alternatives identified in Step 1.

**Output**: Comprehensive list of differentiated capabilities

### Step 3: Map Capabilities to Value
**So what? Why do customers care?**

For each capability, answer: "What value does this enable for the customer?"

**Process:**
1. Take each differentiator
2. Ask "So what?" repeatedly until you reach business/emotional value
3. Group into 2-3 value themes/buckets

**Example:**
- Feature: Shared inbox with assignment
- So what: No customer requests fall through cracks
- So what: Higher customer satisfaction
- Value theme: "Deliver amazing customer service that drives loyalty"

**Output**: 2-3 clear value themes that differentiate you

### Step 4: Define Best-Fit Customers
**Who cares A LOT about this value?**

Not everyone cares equally about your differentiated value. Identify characteristics of accounts that care most:

**Consider:**
- Company size/stage
- Industry/vertical
- Technical environment (what tools they use)
- Organizational structure
- Business model
- Current pain intensity

**The goal**: Be able to identify accounts before talking to them.

**Make it actionable:**
- "Companies with creative teams of 3+ people"
- "E-commerce brands prioritizing customer experience"
- NOT just demographics, but behavioral/situational factors

**Output**: Clear, actionable definition of ideal customer profile (ICP)

### Step 5: Choose Market Category
**What context positions your value as obvious?**

The market category is the context that makes your value immediately understandable.

**Questions to consider:**
- What market does this value clearly belong in?
- What category makes our differentiation obvious?
- What mental model does the customer need?

**Options:**
1. **Existing category**: Position within known space (e.g., "CRM")
2. **Subcategory**: Narrow existing category (e.g., "CRM for real estate")
3. **New category**: Create new frame (harder, only if truly needed)

**Test**: Does positioning in this category make your value proposition immediately clear to your target customers?

**Output**: Clear market category definition

### Step 6: Build the Sales Narrative

**Transform positioning into a story:**

**Structure:**
1. **The shift**: What's changing in the world that creates opportunity?
2. **The problem with alternatives**: Why current options fall short
3. **Your approach**: How you're different and why it matters
4. **Proof**: Evidence this works (customers, data, case studies)
5. **Call to action**: Next step for the customer

**Execution:**
- Storyboard with cross-functional team
- Turn into pitch deck and demo script
- Test with qualified prospects
- Iterate based on feedback

## Expected Outcomes
- Clear, aligned messaging across all teams
- Faster sales cycles (customers understand faster)
- Reduced "no decision" losses
- Better qualified leads
- Pricing power (clear differentiated value)

## Common Pitfalls

### Starting with market category
- Category should be the LAST thing you decide
- Working backwards leads to weak differentiation

### Confusing differentiated value with general value
- "Fast, easy, reliable" isn't differentiated if everyone claims it
- Only include value that alternatives CAN'T deliver

### Ignoring status quo as competitor
- 40% of deals lost to "no decision"
- Must position against spreadsheets, manual processes too

### One team doing positioning in isolation
- Marketing alone can't do this
- Need sales, product, leadership alignment
- Misalignment = weak execution

### Trying to be everything to everyone
- Strong positioning requires trade-offs
- Better to be perfect for some than mediocre for all

### Tightening too early
- Pre-PMF: Keep positioning loose
- Let market pull you to where you win
- Tighten once patterns emerge

## Example: Help Scout

**Competitive alternatives**: Zendesk, email, shared inbox tools

**Differentiated capabilities**:
- Service-focused shared inbox
- Human-first approach (no ticket numbers)
- Chat only when humans available

**Value themes**:
- Deliver amazing customer service
- Deepen customer relationships
- Drive growth through loyalty

**Best-fit customers**:
- D2C e-commerce brands
- Companies that see support as growth driver, not cost center
- Brands prioritizing customer relationships

**Market category**: Customer service platform for relationship-focused businesses

## AI Integration Notes

### Context signals that should trigger this SOP:
- User mentions "positioning," "messaging," "differentiation"
- Confusion about market category
- Sales/marketing misalignment
- "Customers don't understand what we do"

### How to adapt:
- For B2C: Focus more on emotional/social value
- For early-stage: Keep looser, focus on discovering patterns
- For enterprise: Include multiple personas, but prioritize champion

### Key insight:
Good positioning feels obvious. If it's complicated, it's probably wrong. Test with: "Does a qualified prospect immediately get why they need this?"
