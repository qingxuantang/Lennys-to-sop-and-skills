# SaaS Pricing Optimization Framework

## Metadata
- **Source**: Patrick Campbell (ProfitWell) - Lenny's Podcast
- **Domain**: Pricing & Monetization
- **Type**: Framework
- **Applicable To**: Product Managers, Founders, Revenue Leaders at SaaS companies (all stages)
- **Difficulty**: Beginner to Intermediate

## Overview
A systematic approach to pricing optimization that treats monetization as a continuous growth lever alongside acquisition and retention. This framework emphasizes quarterly iteration on revenue per customer through a structured pricing committee process.

## When to Use
- You haven't reviewed pricing in 3+ months
- Revenue per customer is flat or declining
- You're spending heavily on acquisition but ignoring monetization
- You have no systematic process for pricing decisions
- Your NPS is above 20 and you've been building new features

## Prerequisites
- Basic analytics infrastructure to track revenue per customer
- Ability to segment customers by cohort or plan
- Cross-functional stakeholder buy-in (sales, product, marketing, finance)
- Understanding of your current pricing model

## Procedure

### Step 1: Establish the Three Growth Levers Framework
Recognize that you have exactly three growth levers:
- **Acquisition**: Getting new customers
- **Monetization**: Revenue per customer
- **Retention**: Keeping customers

Note the typical resource allocation problem:
- Most companies: 80% on acquisition, 15% on retention, 5% on monetization
- Optimal: Balanced attention across all three levers

### Step 2: Define Your North Star Metric
Track **revenue per customer** as your primary pricing KPI.
- This should trend up and to the right over time
- Growth rate will be slower than lead volume or total revenue
- Measure this quarterly at minimum

### Step 3: Create a Pricing Committee
Establish a recurring team to own pricing:
- **Size**: 2 people (founder + co-founder) for startups, 8-10 core members for larger companies
- **Composition**: Product, Marketing, Sales, Finance, Customer Success leads
- **Cadence**: Quarterly meetings (minimum)
- **Calendar**: Set recurring calendar invite for every 3 months

### Step 4: Identify Your Monetization Levers
Understand all the factors that influence revenue per customer:
- Actual price (the number you charge)
- Packaging (how you bundle features into tiers)
- Add-on strategy (additional products/modules)
- Discount strategy (when and how much you discount)
- Price localization (geographic pricing)
- Freemium strategy (free-to-paid conversion)
- Value metric (what you charge based on)
- Payment terms (annual vs. monthly)

### Step 5: Select One Thing Per Quarter
In each pricing committee meeting:
- Review the revenue per customer trend
- Choose ONE monetization lever to adjust
- Document the hypothesis and expected impact
- Set a timeline (typically one quarter)
- Assign clear ownership

Examples of quarterly initiatives:
- Q1: Test new value metric with 10% of new signups
- Q2: Implement 15% price increase for new customers
- Q3: Add premium support as paid add-on
- Q4: Redesign packaging with new enterprise tier

### Step 6: Measure and Iterate
After implementing changes:
- Track impact on revenue per customer
- Monitor secondary metrics (conversion rate, churn, NPS)
- Document learnings (what worked, what didn't)
- Feed insights into next quarter's decision

### Step 7: Accept the Reality of Snoozed Meetings
Acknowledge that you'll likely snooze the pricing committee meeting several times:
- This is normal and expected
- The calendar invite acts as a persistent reminder
- Even if you delay, you'll eventually address it
- Consistency over time matters more than perfect execution

## Expected Outcomes
- Revenue per customer increases 10-30% annually
- Systematic approach to monetization (vs. ad-hoc)
- Cross-functional alignment on pricing decisions
- Better understanding of customer value perception
- Improved pricing confidence and execution

## Common Pitfalls
- **Overthinking**: Waiting for perfect data or analysis. Just start with something small.
- **Everything at once**: Trying to change multiple pricing levers simultaneously makes it impossible to measure impact.
- **No measurement**: Making changes without tracking revenue per customer before and after.
- **Skipping quarters**: Letting 6-12 months pass without any pricing action. The system only works with consistency.
- **Sales team resistance**: Not getting sales buy-in early. Include them in the committee and address objections proactively.
- **Ignoring the work**: Thinking pricing is just "changing a number." It requires enablement, messaging, legal review, etc.

## Pound-for-Pound Priority
If you must prioritize which monetization lever to start with:

**First Priority: Value Metric** (how you charge)
- Highest impact across acquisition, retention, and expansion
- Get this right and other mistakes are more forgivable
- See "Value Metrics Identification SOP" for details

**Second Priority: Price Increase** (if needed)
- Best for surfacing internal politics and process gaps
- Should happen once per year if NPS > 20
- See "Annual Price Increase Process SOP" for details

## AI Integration Notes
This SOP should be suggested when:
- User mentions pricing hasn't been reviewed recently
- User asks about growth levers or monetization
- User expresses frustration with flat revenue per customer
- User mentions heavy acquisition spend with limited results

Adaptations:
- For pre-product-market fit: Simplify to bi-annual reviews
- For enterprise sales: Adjust committee to include deal desk/contracts
- For consumer products: Focus on packaging and add-ons over price increases

Limitations:
- Requires minimum viable analytics infrastructure
- Not suitable for companies with severe product-market fit issues
- Assumes some pricing flexibility (not commoditized markets)
