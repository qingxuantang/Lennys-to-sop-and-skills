- **Company Stage**: All stages (different methods for different stages)
- **Difficulty**: Intermediate

## Overview
Willingness to pay (WTP) research determines whether customers actually value your product enough to pay for it. This SOP provides methods to validate product-market-pricing fit before building, and to prioritize your roadmap based on what customers will actually pay for.

## When to Use
- Before building a new product (validate the idea has WTP)
- Prioritizing features for your roadmap
- Launching a new pricing strategy
- Entering a new market segment
- Evaluating a pivot
- Refreshing pricing (every 12-18 months minimum)

## Prerequisites
- Clear product concept or prototype
- Access to target customers or prospects
- Ability to articulate value proposition
- Sales/marketing pitch prepared

## Core Concept: Price as a Measure of Value

**Key insight**: Price is not just a dollar figure—it's a measure of value, like liters measure volume.

- If someone says "I like your product" but won't pay → they don't really like it
- 72% of innovations fail because companies don't validate WTP early enough
- "Price before product, period" - First Round

## Procedure

### Step 1: Prepare Your Value Pitch

Before asking about willingness to pay, you must articulate value:

1. Write the same sales/marketing pitch you would use post-launch
2. Clearly explain the problem you solve
3. Describe the benefits (not features)
4. Have supporting materials (mockups, demos, wireframes)

**Critical**: Never ask "how much should I charge?" without first pitching the value.

### Step 2: Choose Your Method Based on Stage

**Early Stage (Idea/Pre-seed):**
- Simple direct questions
- Relative value comparisons
- Focus on qualitative signals

**Growth Stage (Series A-C):**
- Purchase probability questions
- Most/least ranking
- Acceptable/expensive/prohibitive questions

**Mature Stage (Pre-launch optimization):**
- Trade-off exercises
- Conjoint analysis
- Quantitative surveys at scale

### Step 3: Conduct Relative Value Comparisons

People are "absolutely meaningless, relatively super smart."

**Method:**
1. Identify a known reference product (e.g., Salesforce)
2. Ask: "If [Reference Product] was indexed at 100 in value, where would our product be?"
3. Follow up: "If [Reference Product] was indexed at 100 in price, where should we be?"

**Interpretation:**
- If they say 110 on price → you can charge premium
- If they say 80 on value but 60 on price → you have pricing power
- If they say 120 on value but 80 on price → you're underpricing

### Step 4: Use the Three-Question Price Sensitivity Method

After pitching value, ask in sequence:

1. **"What do you think is an acceptable price?"**
   - This is the "no-brainer" price where they love both product AND price
   - Use for growth mode, minimum friction

2. **"What do you think is an expensive price?"**
   - This is the value-priced point: neutral reaction
   - They don't love it, don't hate it, would pay

3. **"What do you think is a prohibitively expensive price?"**
   - This is where they'd laugh you out of the room
   - Never cross this threshold

**At scale**: Look for cliffs in demand curves. When you cross from 99 to 101, if 20-30% suddenly say "expensive" → that's a psychological threshold to hide behind.

**Example**: Rahul Vohra (Superhuman) used this method to arrive at the $30 price point.

### Step 5: Implement Purchase Probability Questions

**Ask**: "On a scale of 1-5, would you buy this product at [price]?"
- 1 = Not at all interested
- 5 = Would buy for certain

**Interpretation** (based on thousands of projects):
- Score 5 = Only 30-50% will actually buy
- Score 4 = Only 10-20% will actually buy
- Score 3 or below = Will never buy

**To build demand curve:**
1. Test multiple price points
2. Track probability scores at each point
3. Find where scores drop significantly

### Step 6: Use Most/Least Feature Ranking

People struggle to rank 10 features 1-10, but can easily identify extremes.

**Method:**
1. Take 6 features from your list of 10
2. Ask: "Which is MOST important? (Must have, will pay for it)"
3. Ask: "Which is LEAST important? (Don't need, won't pay for it)"
4. Repeat with different combinations
5. Build relative ranking from responses

**Outcome**: Prioritized feature list based on what drives WTP

**Key insight**: 20% of what you build drives 80% of WTP. Find this 20%.

### Step 7: Run Trade-Off Exercises (Advanced)

Put customers through realistic buying scenarios:

1. Show Package A with features X, Y, Z at price $P
2. Show Package B with features X, W at price $P-10
3. Ask: "Which would you choose? Or neither?"
4. Vary features and prices across scenarios

**What you learn:**
- Mental models customers use to decide
- Price elasticity
- Feature value attribution
- Optimal package configurations

### Step 8: Ask "Why" 50% of the Time

After any answer, follow up:

**If they say NO:**
- "Why wouldn't you pay for this?"
- Listen for: missing value, wrong features, trust issues

**If they say YES:**
- "Why would you pay for this?"
- Use their words in your value messaging

### Step 9: Scale Your Research

**Minimum sample sizes:**
- B2C: 1,000-2,000 responses for statistical significance
- B2B (20-30 key accounts): Talk to as many as possible
- After ~20 conversations, you'll hear patterns repeat

**Research formats:**
- One-on-one interviews (early stage)
- Focus groups (concept testing)
- Quantitative surveys (validation at scale)
- A/B tests in production (post-launch refinement)

### Step 10: Apply Findings to Product Roadmap

**You cannot prioritize a roadmap without WTP conversation.**

Use findings to:
1. Identify the 20% of features driving 80% of WTP
2. Cut features with no WTP (don't build them)
3. Sequence roadmap by WTP priority
4. Set pricing based on validated thresholds

## Expected Outcomes
- Validated product-market-pricing fit
- Prioritized roadmap based on customer value
- Pricing that captures value appropriately
- Reduced risk of building things nobody will pay for
- Clear value messaging from customer language

## Common Pitfalls

### Asking "How much should I charge?"
- You'll get garbage back
- That's YOUR job to determine
- Use indirect methods instead

### Waiting until launch to ask about pricing
- 72% of innovations fail from late pricing
- Have the conversation as early as possible
- "There is no too early for this conversation"

### Confusing product-market fit with product-market-pricing fit
- "Do you like this headset?" vs "Do you like it at $200?"
- Very different questions with different answers

### Building based on internal priorities
- Internal teams often prioritize wrong features
- "Highlight Connections from Facebook" example: seemed great internally, zero WTP

### Not asking why
- The "why" reveals the real insights
- Should be 50% of your questions

## AI Integration Notes

### Context signals that should trigger this SOP:
- User mentions "pricing research," "willingness to pay"
- Questions about "should I charge for this?"
- Feature prioritization discussions
- Pre-launch pricing decisions

### How to adapt:
- For B2C: Focus on quantitative surveys at scale
- For B2B: Focus on qualitative conversations with key accounts
- For early-stage: Start with simple questions, iterate

### Key numbers:
- 72% = innovations that fail due to late pricing
- 50% = how often to ask "why"
- 20%/80% = features that drive WTP / rest
- 5-4-3 = purchase probability scale interpretation
