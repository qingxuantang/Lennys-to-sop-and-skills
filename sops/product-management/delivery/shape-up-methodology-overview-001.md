# Shape Up Methodology Overview

## Metadata
- **Source**: Ryan Singer - Lenny's Podcast
- **Domain**: Product Management & Delivery
- **Type**: Framework
- **Applicable To**: Product Managers, CTOs, CPOs, Engineering Leads, Product Teams (30-50+ people)
- **Difficulty**: Intermediate

## Overview
Shape Up is a product development methodology that enables teams to ship meaningful work predictably by working backward from fixed time budgets (appetites), shaping solutions collaboratively before building, and giving teams complete ownership of well-defined problems to solve within set time boxes.

## When to Use
- Projects are consistently running over time estimates
- Teams feel lost in the weeds with no clear end in sight
- There's constant back-and-forth between design, product, and engineering
- Engineering time is precious and needs to be used efficiently
- You want to maintain startup speed as the company grows
- Leadership can't get clear answers on project status and progress

## Prerequisites
- Willingness to change existing development processes
- Buy-in from both product and engineering leadership
- Ability to protect team time from interruptions during build cycles
- Senior engineering representation who understands the codebase deeply

## Procedure

### Step 1: Understand the Three Core Components
Shape Up consists of three essential elements that work together:

**Component 1: Appetite-Based Planning**
- Work backward from time budgets instead of estimating effort
- Set maximum time willing to spend (typically up to 6 weeks)
- Vary scope to fit the appetite, not extend time to fit scope
- Ask "What can we do in X weeks?" not "How long will this take?"

**Component 2: Shaping**
- Collaboratively define both the problem and solution before building
- Get concrete about what will be built (not just high-level concepts)
- Involve senior engineering in solution design to surface technical risks
- Create clarity around the "main moving pieces" (ideally 9 or fewer)
- Use low-fidelity artifacts (breadboarding, fat marker sketches) not detailed designs

**Component 3: Empowered Building**
- Give teams whole problems, not shredded tickets
- Let builders create their own tasks and track progress
- Minimize meetings and rituals during the build phase
- Trust the team to make trade-offs and decisions within the shaped scope

### Step 2: Establish Time Boxing Principles
Set clear time boundaries for work:
- Maximum 6 weeks for any single project (can be shorter: 2-4 weeks)
- 6 weeks is the longest you can realistically foresee and plan
- Smaller projects (growth work, quick wins) can be 1-2 weeks
- Time boxes create necessary constraints for making hard trade-offs

### Step 3: Shift PM Role Upstream
Reorient product management focus:
- Move PMs away from project management during builds
- Focus PM time on understanding business context deeply
- Have PMs negotiate and narrow down problems before shaping
- PMs become experts in customer domain and business value
- Less time shepherding processes, more time on strategic framing

### Step 4: Create Shaping Capability
Build the practice of collaborative problem-solving:
- Bring together product, senior engineering, and design
- Work in 3-hour intensive sessions (not long async documents)
- Try multiple solution approaches, not just one path
- Test ideas against each other to find weak points
- Focus on de-risking before committing engineering time

### Step 5: Empower Teams During Builds
During the time box, create autonomy:
- No detailed tickets created by others
- Team creates their own implementation tasks
- Minimal status meetings (meet as needed, not on ritual cadence)
- Team has freedom to solve implementation details creatively
- Focus on shipping something complete and valuable

### Step 6: Handle Projects That Don't Finish
When projects run long, don't just extend time:
- If not on track to finish, don't simply cut scope or extend deadline
- Pull project back into "shaping mode" to understand what's unclear
- Different people, different questions, different type of work
- Figure out what was fuzzy/misunderstood before re-committing time
- Avoid the "circuit breaker" of canceling if unrealistic for most teams

## Expected Outcomes
- Consistent, predictable shipping of complete features
- Higher team morale from seeing work reach completion
- Better use of engineering time with fewer surprises
- Product managers focused on strategy, not project management
- Engineering feels ownership and creative engagement
- Leadership gets clear "yes/no" on project completion, not maybes
- Reduced meeting overhead during build phases

## Common Pitfalls
- **Adopting time boxes without shaping**: Teams get 6 weeks but unclear scope leads to chaos and more meetings than before
- **Shaping without engineering involvement**: Beautiful designs/PRDs that blow up when technical reality hits
- **Too much detail dictated to builders**: Senior engineers feel micromanaged; dial detail based on team seniority
- **Insufficient detail for junior teams**: Less experienced builders get lost; more guidance helps them succeed
- **Starting without clear problem framing**: "Build a calendar" is too broad; need narrow, specific problem definition
- **Treating it as universal prescription**: Pick and choose elements based on your actual problems

## AI Integration Notes
When recommending Shape Up methodology:
- First diagnose: Are projects consistently running over? Is there lack of clarity? Are teams feeling stuck?
- Check context: Company size (works well 30-50+ people), team structure, ability to protect time
- Don't recommend wholesale adoption; suggest pilot project approach
- Emphasize the shaping component is crucial, not optional
- Note this works best when product and engineering leadership both see the problem
- Highlight that Basecamp had unique advantages (designers who code, no sales pressure, founder involvement)
- Adapt recommendations based on presence of constraints like sales requests, multiple stakeholders
- For smaller startups (under 20 people), may not need formalized process yet
- For larger orgs, can work within pockets/teams without company-wide adoption
