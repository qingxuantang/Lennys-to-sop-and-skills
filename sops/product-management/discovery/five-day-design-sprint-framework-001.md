## Metadata
- **Source**: Jake Knapp + John Zeratsky - Lenny's Podcast
- **Domain**: Product Management & Discovery
- **Type**: Process
- **Applicable To**: Product teams, startups, founders (pre-seed to growth stage), product managers, designers, engineers
- **Difficulty**: Intermediate

## Overview
The Design Sprint is a five-day structured process that takes teams from zero to a tested prototype. Created at Google and refined at Google Ventures across hundreds of teams, it enables rapid decision-making, prototype creation, and customer validation without months of development. The sprint changes the defaults of how teams work by clearing calendars, eliminating distractions, and focusing entirely on building and testing a realistic prototype that proves (or disproves) a hypothesis.

## When to Use
- Starting a new product or major feature from scratch
- Facing a high-risk decision or direction with unclear outcomes
- Need to validate product-market fit quickly before significant development
- Team has different ideas and needs alignment on direction
- Launching a new marketing campaign or major initiative
- Stuck on a project that's been going nowhere for months
- Want to test 3-4 weeks of work in one week
- Need customer feedback on a concept before building

## Prerequisites
- **Team commitment**: Core team (founders, PM, design, engineering, marketing leads) clears calendars for full week
- **Decision-maker identified**: One person (usually CEO or CPO) designated to make final calls
- **Customer access**: Ability to recruit 4-5 target customers for Friday testing
- **Founding hypothesis**: Clear hypothesis about what problem you're solving and for whom (ideally from Foundation Sprint)
- **Physical/digital workspace**: Room with whiteboards or Miro board for remote teams
- **Tools ready**: Prototyping tools (Figma, code, AI tools, etc.) available

## Procedure

### Day 1: Map (Monday)
**Goal**: Understand the problem space and identify the critical moment to test

1. **Set the long-term goal**
   - Write down what success looks like in 6 months to 2 years
   - Frame as: "What do we want to be true about our product/company?"
   - Example: "Artisans can easily sell online through community recommendations"

2. **List sprint questions**
   - Identify biggest risks and unknowns as questions
   - Example: "Will artisans actually want a community sharing platform?"
   - Prioritize by which risks matter most right now

3. **Create a customer journey map**
   - Map out how customers discover, evaluate, use, and get value from product
   - Keep it simple: 5-15 steps maximum
   - Show all actors involved (customer, other users, systems)
   - Mark moments where things could go wrong

4. **Interview experts**
   - Talk to anyone on team with relevant knowledge (15 mins each)
   - Capture insights as "How Might We" notes
   - Ask about technical constraints, customer insights, business model, etc.

5. **Pick the target**
   - Review the map and sprint questions
   - Decider chooses which part of journey to focus on
   - Select the moment that best addresses biggest risk
   - This becomes your prototype focus area

### Day 2: Sketch (Tuesday)
**Goal**: Generate solution ideas individually through structured sketching

1. **Lightning demos** (60 minutes)
   - Each person shares inspiring solutions from other products
   - Look inside and outside your industry
   - Capture good ideas on whiteboard/Miro
   - Focus on specific components or approaches, not entire products

2. **Divide or swarm decision**
   - If target is too big, divide into smaller pieces for different team members
   - If manageable, everyone "swarms" on same target
   - Assign areas if dividing

3. **Note-taking and idea generation** (20 minutes)
   - Review map, "How Might We" notes, and lightning demos
   - Each person takes notes individually and quietly
   - No discussing - silent solo work

4. **Four-step sketching process**
   - **Notes**: Walk around, review materials, jot down ideas (20 min)
   - **Ideas**: Rough doodles, mind maps, stick figures of possibilities (20 min)
   - **Crazy 8s**: Fold paper into 8 panels, sketch 8 variations in 8 minutes (8 min)
   - **Solution sketch**: Create detailed 3-panel storyboard of best idea (30-90 min)

5. **Make solution sketches self-explanatory**
   - Use words and annotations
   - Give it a catchy title
   - Make it so anyone can understand without explanation
   - Keep sketcher anonymous for now

### Day 3: Decide (Wednesday)
**Goal**: Choose the best solution(s) to prototype

1. **Sticky decision process**
   - **Art museum**: Tape solution sketches on wall
   - **Heat map**: Each person puts dot stickers on interesting parts (silent, 10 min)
   - **Speed critique**: Review each sketch in 3 minutes
     - Facilitator narrates the sketch
     - Team calls out standout ideas
     - Sketcher explains what they missed
     - Scribe captures big ideas
   - **Straw poll**: Each person votes for one solution with one vote
   - **Super vote**: Decider makes final call with special votes (3 dots)

2. **Plan the prototype**
   - Decide if testing one solution or multiple (recommend testing 2-3 head-to-head)
   - Create storyboard: 10-15 frames showing customer journey through prototype
   - Each frame is one screen/moment
   - Use words, stick figures, and actual UI where needed
   - Storyboard becomes blueprint for prototype

3. **Assign roles for Thursday**
   - **Maker(s)**: Who builds the prototype
   - **Stitcher**: Assembles pieces into cohesive prototype
   - **Writer**: Writes realistic copy
   - **Asset collector**: Gathers images, content, data
   - **Interviewer**: Prepares test script for Friday

### Day 4: Prototype (Thursday)
**Goal**: Build realistic-looking prototype(s) that customers will react to authentically

1. **Adopt "prototype mindset"**
   - Just enough to test, not production-ready
   - Appearance over functionality
   - Make it look real enough that customers believe it
   - Fake it before you make it

2. **Choose prototyping approach based on what you're testing**
   - Landing pages: Use webpage builders, Figma, or AI coding
   - App interfaces: Figma, Keynote, PowerPoint with clickable states
   - Service experiences: Role-play with props
   - Physical products: Modify existing products or 3D print
   - Technical demos: Screen recordings with voiceover
   - AI products: Combination of vibe coding, real code, and product videos

3. **Build in parallel**
   - Makers work on individual screens/components
   - Writer creates all copy and messaging
   - Asset collector finds realistic images, data, content
   - Stitcher assembles everything by end of day
   - Interviewer writes test script and recruits customers

4. **Test the prototype internally**
   - Do trial run at 3-4 PM
   - Fix obvious problems
   - Ensure prototype tells complete story
   - Confirm technology works (links click, videos play)

5. **Prepare for testing**
   - Finalize interview script
   - Confirm all 5 customers for Friday
   - Set up observation room/video stream for team
   - Brief team on how to take notes

### Day 5: Test (Friday)
**Goal**: Get customer reactions and validate (or invalidate) hypothesis

1. **Conduct 5 one-on-one interviews** (60 minutes each)
   - Welcome and context setting (5 min)
   - Background questions about their situation (5-10 min)
   - Introduce prototype(s) (5 min)
   - Tasks and usability test (25-30 min)
   - Debrief questions (10 min)

2. **Use "scorecard" method** (new innovation)
   - Create scorecard based on founding hypothesis
   - For each customer, mark red/yellow/green for:
     - Was this the right customer type?
     - Do they have the problem we think they have?
     - Is this the right approach?
     - Would they choose it over competition?
     - Did differentiation resonate?
     - Did it "click" with them?
   - See patterns across customers

3. **Team observation**
   - Entire team watches interviews (separate room or video)
   - Take notes individually
   - Look for patterns, surprises, strong reactions
   - Note exact quotes

4. **Debrief and decide** (60 minutes)
   - Review scorecard together
   - Identify patterns: What worked? What didn't?
   - Decide next steps:
     - **All green**: Build it, high confidence
     - **Mixed results**: Identify what to fix, sprint again
     - **All red**: Pivot to backup plan, sprint again
   - Update founding hypothesis based on learnings

## Expected Outcomes
- **Tested prototype** in customer hands after 5 days instead of months
- **Clear evidence** of what works and what doesn't with real customers
- **Team alignment** on direction with no ambiguity
- **Reduced risk** before committing to full development
- **Customer insights** that inform product direction
- **3-4 months of work compressed** into one week
- **Momentum and energy** from seeing tangible progress

## Common Pitfalls

### Pitfall 1: Not actually clearing calendars
- **Problem**: Team members half-participate, check email, take meetings
- **Impact**: Lose the sprint's power, decisions get delayed, energy drops
- **Solution**: Literally block all meetings, turn off Slack/email, treat it like off-site

### Pitfall 2: Skipping straight to prototyping
- **Problem**: Jump to building without doing foundation or mapping work
- **Impact**: Generic solutions, misaligned team, wrong problem
- **Solution**: Trust the process, do Day 1 and 2 even if it feels slow

### Pitfall 3: Making prototype too real or too fake
- **Problem**: Over-build production code OR create obvious fake that customers dismiss
- **Impact**: Waste time OR get invalid feedback
- **Solution**: Make it look completely real but work minimally (smoke and mirrors)

### Pitfall 4: Testing with wrong customers
- **Problem**: Use colleagues, friends, or people who don't match target
- **Impact**: False validation or rejection
- **Solution**: Recruit actual target customers, pay them if needed

### Pitfall 5: Not having designated decider
- **Problem**: Decisions by committee, endless discussion, no progress
- **Impact**: Sprint drags, team gets frustrated, miss deadline
- **Solution**: One person has final say (usually CEO/founder), everyone respects it

### Pitfall 6: Ignoring red flags in testing
- **Problem**: Seeing what you want to see, dismissing negative signals
- **Impact**: Build wrong thing for months
- **Solution**: Use scorecard objectively, look for patterns not individual opinions

### Pitfall 7: Using AI without thinking first
- **Problem**: Vibe code generic prototype that looks good but has no differentiation
- **Impact**: Test generic solution, miss what makes you unique
- **Solution**: Do detailed sketches first, use AI for execution not ideation

## AI Integration Notes

### Context Signals for This SOP
- Team mentions "we need to validate this idea quickly"
- Phrases like "we've been discussing this for weeks with no decision"
- "Should we build this feature or that feature?"
- "We're not sure if customers will want this"
- Team has different views on product direction
- Need evidence before committing to development

### How to Adapt for Different Situations
- **Early-stage startup**: Run Foundation Sprint first, then Design Sprint
- **New feature in existing product**: Focus sprint on specific feature area
- **AI products**: Use combination of vibe coding, real code, and video demos
- **Technical/complex products**: Invest more in detailed sketches before prototyping
- **Solo founders**: Can run solo, generate multiple ideas yourself for variety
- **Remote teams**: Use Miro extensively, ensure video setup works perfectly
- **Hardware products**: Modify existing products or use high-quality renderings
- **Service design**: Role-play service with props and actors

### Limitations and Edge Cases
- **Doesn't work if**: Product already has strong traction (just build)
- **Doesn't work if**: Team won't commit calendars (partial sprint fails)
- **Hard if**: Can't access target customers for testing (need creative recruitment)
- **Not ideal for**: Pure research with no hypothesis to test
- **Be careful**: Don't run sprint after sprint without building (analysis paralysis)
- **Watch out**: Pattern of all-green results might mean confirmation bias

### Success Metrics
- 5 customer interviews completed
- Clear scorecard with patterns identified
- Team unanimous on next steps
- Hypothesis validated or invalidated with evidence
- Renewed team energy and alignment
- Reduced time-to-learning from months to days
