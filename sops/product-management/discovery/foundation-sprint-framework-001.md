# Foundation Sprint Framework

## Metadata
- **Source**: Jake Knapp + John Zeratsky - Lenny's Podcast
- **Domain**: Product Management & Strategy
- **Type**: Process
- **Applicable To**: Pre-seed to Series A founders, product teams starting new projects, startup teams (0-50 people), product managers defining new products
- **Difficulty**: Beginner to Intermediate

## Overview
The Foundation Sprint is a 10-hour (typically 2-day) structured process that establishes the strategic foundation for a new product or company before any building begins. Created at Character Capital after working with 300+ teams, it emerged from the insight that teams need clarity on basics, differentiation, and approach before running Design Sprints. The output is a "founding hypothesis" - a clear, testable statement of who you're building for, what problem you're solving, how you'll differentiate, and which implementation path to take.

## When to Use
- Starting a new company or product from zero
- Have multiple directions and unsure which to pursue
- Team has different perspectives on customer, problem, or approach
- Before committing to months of development
- Raised pre-seed funding and need strategic clarity
- Joining an accelerator or working with investors
- Have a technical insight but unclear how to commercialize it
- Know you want to solve a problem but not sure for whom or how
- Team keeps changing direction week to week
- Before running Design Sprints (recommended prerequisite)

## Prerequisites
- **Core team availability**: 10-12 hours over 2 days (can be 2 consecutive days or split)
- **Team members**: Co-founders OR core leadership (PM, engineering, design, marketing)
- **Designated decision-maker**: One person (usually CEO/founder) makes final calls
- **Workspace**: Physical room with whiteboards OR Miro board with template
- **Basic problem clarity**: Some sense of problem space, even if fuzzy
- **Open mindset**: Willingness to challenge assumptions and change direction

## Procedure

### Phase 1: The Basics (2-3 hours)
**Goal**: Establish fundamental clarity on customer, problem, competition, and advantages

#### Step 1: Identify the Most Important Customer
- **Process**: Work Alone Together (Note and Vote)
  - Everyone silently writes their answers on sticky notes (5 min)
  - Post all answers, read silently
  - Each person votes on best options
  - Decider makes final call
- **Be specific**: Not "small businesses" but "artisans who want to sell online but find tech/marketing hard"
- **One customer type only**: You can serve others later, but laser focus now
- **Write it on The Basics sheet**

#### Step 2: Define the Problem
- Use same Note and Vote process
- Frame as: "What specific problem does this customer have?"
- Examples:
  - NOT: "Need better software"
  - YES: "Sales growth"
  - YES: "Complex geospatial workflows"
- Distinguish urgency vs. satisfaction vs. joy aspects
- Write chosen problem on The Basics sheet

#### Step 3: Identify Competition
- List ALL ways customers solve this problem today:
  - **Direct competitors**: Other products doing same thing
  - **Alternative solutions**: Different approaches to same problem
  - **Workarounds**: How they cope without a solution
  - **Status quo**: Just dealing with it
- Examples for artisan marketplace:
  - Direct: Shopify, Etsy
  - Alternative: In-person art fairs
  - Workaround: Word-of-mouth sales only
- Pick top 2-3 as main competition
- Write on The Basics sheet

#### Step 4: List Your Advantages
- **Capability**: What can you build that others can't?
  - Example: "Built Substack's network growth features"
- **Insight**: What do you know that others don't?
  - Example: "Understand how newsletter recommendations drive growth"
- **Motivation**: Why do you care more than others?
  - Example: "Founder was frustrated artisan for 5 years"
- Write 2-4 key advantages on The Basics sheet

**Output**: One-page "Basics" sheet with clear answers to customer, problem, competition, advantages

### Phase 2: Differentiation (4-6 hours)
**Goal**: Define your unique promise to customers that makes them choose you over alternatives

**Why this matters**: People ignore new products by default. You need a radically clear promise that's meaningfully different from alternatives to break through. This isn't about technology or market opportunity - it's about the customer-facing promise.

#### Step 5: Score Classic Differentiators
- Use template with standard differentiators:
  - Fast → Slow
  - Smart → Not so smart
  - Easy to use → Hard to use
  - Free → Expensive
  - Focused → One-size-fits-all
  - Simple → Complicated
  - Integrated → Siloed
- For each, plot on scale where you think product could be
- Plot where competitors are
- Look for gaps where you could stand out
- Don't expect to win on all (or even most)

#### Step 6: Create Custom Differentiators
- Brainstorm new continuums specific to your opportunity
  - Example: "Networked ↔ Siloed"
  - Example: "Painless business growth ↔ Labor-intensive"
  - Example: "Cooperative ↔ Competitive"
  - Example: "Magical ↔ Mundane"
- Generate 15-25 custom differentiators (silent note-taking)
- Vote on most interesting ones
- Pick top 8-12 to explore further

#### Step 7: Score Against Competition
- Take most promising differentiators
- Create scale for each (1-5 or 1-10)
- Plot your product honestly
- Plot each competitor honestly
- Look for where you can be meaningfully different
- Look for combinations that matter to customers

#### Step 8: Choose Your Two Differentiators
- Review all scored differentiators
- Decider picks the two strongest
- Criteria:
  - Can you actually deliver on this? (be honest)
  - Will customers care about this difference?
  - Does this leverage your advantages?
  - Can you win here vs. competition?
  - Does combination create unique quadrant?

#### Step 9: Create 2x2 Differentiation Chart
- X-axis: First differentiator (good ↔ bad)
- Y-axis: Second differentiator (good ↔ bad)
- Plot your product in top-right
- Plot all competitors in other three quadrants
- This creates your "Loserville" - where competitors live
- Examples:
  - Latchet: "Helps you grow" + "Cooperative"
  - Mellow: "Mobile-first" + "Works out of the box"

#### Step 10: Write Project Principles
- Turn differentiation into decision-making guides
- Format: Action-oriented statements
- Examples:
  - "Help sellers help each other"
  - "Do the thing that makes sellers more money"
  - "Choose the approach that works out of the box"
- Write 3-5 principles
- These guide all future decisions

**Output**: "Mini Manifesto" - one page with 2x2 chart and principles

### Phase 3: Approach (3-4 hours)
**Goal**: Choose the best implementation path from multiple options

#### Step 11: List Possible Approaches
- Identify 3-5 different ways to deliver on same promise
- Key: All solve SAME problem for SAME customer with SAME differentiation
- Just different paths to get there
- Examples for Latchet:
  - App
  - Newsletter platform
  - Shopify plugin
  - Full-stack solution
- Label each option (A, B, C, D)
- Assign colors for visual tracking

#### Step 12: Apply Magic Lenses
Create scales for each lens and plot each approach:

**Customer Lens**:
- Easy to use ↔ Hard to use
- Perfect solution ↔ Partial solution

**Pragmatic Lens**:
- Cheap/fast to build ↔ Expensive/slow to build

**Growth Lens**:
- Easy to adopt ↔ Hard to adopt
- Reaches many customers ↔ Reaches few customers

**Financial Lens**:
- High long-term value ↔ Low long-term value
- Large addressable market ↔ Small addressable market

**Differentiation Lens**:
- Strongly differentiated ↔ Weakly differentiated

**Conviction Lens** (optional but recommended):
- F*ck yeah! ↔ Meh

**Custom Lenses** (create 1-3 specific to your situation):
- Example: "Plays to our strengths ↔ Requires new skills"
- Example: "Defensible moat ↔ Easy to copy"

#### Step 13: Analyze and Decide
- Look across all lenses
- **Option A: Clear winner across most lenses**
  - Choose that approach as first choice
  - Pick second-best as backup
- **Option B: No clear winner**
  - Identify which lens matters most
  - Choose approach that wins on most important lens
  - Pick backup from different lens
- **Option C: Tie on important lenses**
  - Decider makes call based on conviction
  - Choose backup that hedges risk

#### Step 14: Write Founding Hypothesis
Fill in this Mad Libs sentence:

"If we help **[customer]** solve **[problem]** with **[approach]**, we believe they'll choose it over **[competition]** because **[differentiator 1]** and **[differentiator 2]**."

Example:
"If we help artisans solve online sales growth with a social sales app, we believe they'll choose it over Shopify and Etsy because our solution is cooperative and helps them grow."

Add backup plan:
"Or we could **[backup approach]** if that doesn't work."

**Output**: Complete founding hypothesis with backup plan

## Expected Outcomes
- **Crystal-clear strategy** in one sentence
- **Team alignment** - everyone knows exactly what we're building and why
- **Testable hypothesis** ready for Design Sprints
- **Decision-making framework** (principles) for all future choices
- **Reduced wasted effort** - won't spend months building wrong thing
- **Confidence or pivots** - know what to test first
- **10 hours invested** that saves months of misalignment

## Common Pitfalls

### Pitfall 1: Skipping to prototyping without this foundation
- **Problem**: "We already know what to build, let's just start"
- **Impact**: Team has different ideas, product ends up generic, misses differentiation
- **Solution**: Even if you "know," spend the 10 hours - you'll find surprises

### Pitfall 2: Choosing generic differentiators
- **Problem**: Picking "fast" and "easy to use" like everyone else
- **Impact**: No unique position, product doesn't stand out
- **Solution**: Push for custom differentiators that create new lens on the world

### Pitfall 3: Being unrealistic about where you can win
- **Problem**: Plotting yourself better than Google/OpenAI on all dimensions
- **Impact**: False confidence, build wrong thing
- **Solution**: Be brutally honest in scoring, especially vs. big competitors

### Pitfall 4: Not being specific enough on customer
- **Problem**: "Businesses" or "developers" - too broad
- **Impact**: Can't make crisp decisions, try to serve everyone
- **Solution**: Get hyper-specific - "geospatial devs" not "developers"

### Pitfall 5: Confusing technology advantage with customer differentiation
- **Problem**: Differentiate on "uses AI" or "blockchain-based"
- **Impact**: Customers don't care about tech, they care about outcomes
- **Solution**: Frame differentiation from customer's perspective, not yours

### Pitfall 6: Choosing approach without lenses
- **Problem**: Go with gut or first idea discussed
- **Impact**: Miss better options, team not aligned on trade-offs
- **Solution**: Actually plot on magic lenses, see visual patterns

### Pitfall 7: Not defining backup plan
- **Problem**: All-in on one approach with no alternative
- **Impact**: Fear of testing honestly, pressure to make it work
- **Solution**: Always pick backup, makes pivoting less scary

## AI Integration Notes

### Context Signals for This SOP
- "We're starting a new company/product"
- "We have a few ideas but can't decide which"
- "Our team keeps debating who the customer should be"
- "We've been building for weeks but it feels unfocused"
- "About to raise/raised pre-seed funding"
- "Need to figure out our positioning"
- "What makes us different from competitors?"

### How to Adapt for Different Situations

**For AI-first products**:
- Be extra careful not to differentiate on "uses AI" - everyone does
- Look for 10X improvement over manual process (not just marginal)
- Consider "trustworthy" and "transparent" as differentiators
- Watch out for generic AI-generated solutions

**For solo founders**:
- Still do Note and Vote - write multiple options yourself
- Benefits from external perspective (advisor, co-founder candidate)
- Conviction lens becomes more important
- Can complete in 6-8 hours instead of 10

**For B2B/enterprise**:
- Customer definition even more critical (role, company size, industry)
- "Integrated" often key differentiator
- Financial lens weights heavily
- Consider "sales cycle" as custom differentiator

**For marketplace/platform**:
- Define customer as demand-side (usually)
- Consider network effects in differentiation
- Growth lens becomes critical
- May need separate Foundation Sprint for supply side

**For existing company, new product**:
- Leverage existing advantages (brand, distribution, data)
- Watch for "new lens" differentiators that cannibalize existing products
- Consider "integrated with our ecosystem" as advantage
- Growth lens can value existing channels

### Limitations and Edge Cases
- **Doesn't replace** customer research (but informs what to test)
- **Not needed if** product already has traction (just build/iterate)
- **Hard if** no team (solo founder should recruit advisor/friend to partner)
- **Difficult when** team has huge power imbalances (junior PM can't challenge CEO)
- **May need iteration** if first hypothesis completely fails in testing
- **Requires honesty** - won't work if team just tells each other what they want to hear

### Success Metrics
- Founding hypothesis written and team aligned
- Can explain differentiation in one sentence
- Team unanimous on next steps
- Backup approach identified
- Everyone clear on decision-making principles
- 2x2 chart shows clear unique position
- Ready to start Design Sprint immediately
- Saves 3-4 months of misaligned building
