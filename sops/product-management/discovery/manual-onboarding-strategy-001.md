- **Company Stage**: Pre-PMF to Series A

## Overview
A strategic framework for manually onboarding every new user through one-on-one concierge experiences, using human-powered activation to accelerate product-market fit finding while deferring the need to build self-service flows. Includes guidance on when to start, how to scale, and critically, when to stop.

## When to Use
- You're in the pre-PMF to early PMF stage
- You can raise funding to support a human-powered approach
- Your product has significant learning curve or requires behavior change
- You want exceptional early user metrics (engagement, retention, PMF score)
- You need to build a strong early brand and word-of-mouth
- You can afford to trade money for engineering time

## When NOT to Use
- You've already found strong product-market fit
- You need massive top-of-funnel volume
- Your unit economics don't support human touch
- Certain personality types won't tolerate required onboarding
- You're in a self-service category (e.g., simple consumer tools)

## Prerequisites
- Access to capital (typically VC funding)
- Product that requires setup or learning
- Target customers with high enough LTV to justify cost
- Ability to hire and train onboarding team
- Basic product functionality in place

## Core Trade-Off

**What you gain**:
- Best-in-class user metrics (engagement, retention, NPS, PMF score)
- Deep user insights from hundreds of conversations
- Strong early brand and word-of-mouth foundation
- Avoid building first-time user experience (FTUE) before PMF
- Avoid building activation funnels before PMF
- Focus all engineering on product-market fit, not self-service

**What you sacrifice**:
- Capital (human costs vs. engineering costs)
- Growth velocity (limited by human capacity)
- Some user segments (those who refuse manual onboarding)
- Scalability (eventually must build self-service anyway)

**The calculation**: If capital is available and cheap (ZIRP era, well-funded AI startups), trade dollars for time by avoiding premature FTUE/growth engineering.

## Procedure

### Step 1: Design the Concierge Onboarding Experience

**Superhuman's 30-minute onboarding**:
1. Understand user's email workflow and pain points
2. Set up account and import email
3. Teach keyboard shortcuts progressively
4. Customize settings to user's needs
5. Guide through first email processing session
6. Answer questions and troubleshoot
7. Set expectations for ongoing support

**Your framework**:

1. **Pre-onboarding**:
   - Send welcome email with what to expect
   - Calendar booking for onboarding session
   - Pre-work if needed (questionnaire, data to gather)

2. **Setup phase (5-10 minutes)**:
   - Technical configuration
   - Account setup
   - Integrations

3. **Education phase (10-15 minutes)**:
   - Core workflows
   - Key features (not all features)
   - Best practices
   - Common pitfalls

4. **Hands-on practice (10-15 minutes)**:
   - User does tasks with guidance
   - Correct mistakes in real-time
   - Build confidence

5. **Q&A and next steps (5 minutes)**:
   - Answer questions
   - Set expectations
   - Provide resources
   - Book follow-up if needed

**Duration**: 30-45 minutes is optimal. Long enough to ensure success, short enough to scale.

### Step 2: Build and Scale the Onboarding Team

**Hiring profile**:
- Excellent communicators (written and verbal)
- Patient and empathetic
- Product-minded (can gather insights)
- Technical enough to troubleshoot
- Enthusiastic about your product

**Superhuman's scale**:
- Peak: ~20 people doing manual onboarding
- Each person: ~6-8 onboardings per day
- Total capacity: ~100-150 onboardings per day
- This supported significant growth while maintaining quality

**Training program**:
1. Shadow experienced onboarders (5-10 sessions)
2. Co-facilitate with mentor (5-10 sessions)
3. Lead with observer (5-10 sessions)
4. Independent with spot checks
5. Continuous improvement (review recordings, share learnings)

**Quality control**:
- Record sessions (with permission) for training
- Measure user satisfaction post-onboarding
- Track activation and retention by onboarder
- Regular team training and calibration

### Step 3: Make Onboarding Required (Initially)

**Policy**: You cannot use the product without completing onboarding.

**Why this works**:
- Ensures high activation rates
- Guarantees every user understands core value
- Prevents bad first impressions from confused users
- Creates consistent baseline experience

**Enforcement**:
- Product literally doesn't work until onboarding complete
- Or: Feature-limited until onboarding (softer approach)
- Or: Strong nudges but not hard requirement (softest)

**Superhuman's approach**: Hard requirement. You couldn't use Superhuman without onboarding.

### Step 4: Use Onboarding for Product Insights

**Treat onboarders as user researchers**:

Every onboarding is a user interview opportunity:
- What questions do users ask?
- Where do they get confused?
- What features excite them?
- What workflows do they have?
- What alternatives are they comparing to?

**Systematic collection**:
1. Onboarders log common questions/issues
2. Weekly team meetings to review patterns
3. Monthly synthesis to product team
4. Product roadmap informed by insights

**This is a huge advantage**: You're talking to hundreds of users deeply. Most companies never get this level of user understanding.

### Step 5: Measure the Impact

**Track metrics unique to manual onboarding**:

1. **Onboarding completion rate**: What % who book actually complete?
2. **Time to value**: How long from signup to first success?
3. **Activation rate**: % of onboarded users who become active
4. **Retention by cohort**: Do onboarded users retain better?
5. **PMF score**: Very disappointed % (should be very high)
6. **NPS**: Net Promoter Score (should beat industry benchmarks)
7. **Referral rate**: Do onboarded users refer others more?

**Superhuman's results**:
- "Significantly beat industry benchmarks" on all metrics
- High engagement and retention
- Strong PMF score
- Excellent word-of-mouth

**ROI calculation**:
```
Cost per onboarding = (Team salary + overhead) / onboardings per month
LTV of onboarded user = Average revenue × retention rate
ROI = LTV / Cost per onboarding

Should be >3x for this to make economic sense
```

### Step 6: Know When to Transition to Self-Service

**Signals it's time to stop mandatory manual onboarding**:

1. **User resistance**:
   - Growing segment won't tolerate required onboarding
   - You're losing valuable users who want self-service
   - Personality types who value autonomy are important

2. **Market expansion**:
   - Moving to segments that expect self-service
   - Enterprise customers who want to roll out at scale
   - International markets with different expectations

3. **Economic pressure**:
   - Unit economics no longer support human touch
   - Capital is less available
   - Need to improve margins

4. **Scale constraints**:
   - Can't hire/train fast enough
   - Top of funnel outpacing capacity
   - Wait times getting too long

5. **Product maturity**:
   - Product is stable and intuitive enough
   - You've learned what you need from onboardings
   - Self-service would work now

**Superhuman's decision**:
- "At a certain point those people [who won't do manual onboarding] will become very important"
- Transitioned because certain user segments required self-service option
- Had strong product and understood their users deeply

### Step 7: Build World-Class Self-Service

**Why the transition is hard**:
- Your entire company DNA is built around manual onboarding
- You've never needed to build FTUE flows
- Your product may have gaps that manual onboarding covered
- Culture shift required

**Superhuman's experience**:
- "It seemed nearly impossible. It was terrifying."
- "Entire DNA of company built around manual onboarding"
- "Did so much in one-on-one onboardings, only so much software can do"

**How to make the transition**:

1. **Learn from manual onboardings**:
   - What do onboarders teach every time? (Codify this)
   - Where do users get stuck? (Fix these first)
   - What's the minimum viable understanding? (Focus here)

2. **Build incrementally**:
   - Start with optional self-service track
   - Measure completion and activation
   - Iterate based on drop-off points
   - Gradually shift more users to self-service

3. **Maintain optional manual onboarding**:
   - Offer it as premium/concierge option
   - For enterprise customers
   - For complex use cases
   - Not required, but available

4. **Over-invest in the experience**:
   - Interactive tutorials
   - Progressive disclosure
   - Contextual help
   - Video walkthroughs
   - In-app guidance

**Result**: "We have world-class self-service experience today" (Superhuman)

### Step 8: Determine the Right Model for Your Product

**Decision matrix**:

| Your Situation | Recommended Approach |
|----------------|---------------------|
| Pre-PMF, funded, complex product | Required manual onboarding |
| Early PMF, funded, learning curve | Optional manual onboarding |
| Strong PMF, growing, funded | Self-service default, manual available |
| Strong PMF, margin pressure | Self-service only, maybe concierge for enterprise |
| Simple product, self-serve market | Self-service from day one |

## Expected Outcomes

**If done well**:
- 90%+ activation rates (vs. 20-40% typical for self-service)
- Industry-leading retention and engagement
- 40%+ "very disappointed" (PMF score)
- Strong word-of-mouth and brand
- Deep product insights from user conversations
- Faster time to PMF (engineering focused on product, not FTUE)
- Loyal early customer base

**Costs**:
- $50k-$150k+ per year per onboarding person
- For 20 people: $1-3M/year in team costs
- Slower growth than self-service at scale
- Eventually need to build self-service anyway

## Common Pitfalls

### Pitfall 1: Doing manual onboarding with poor unit economics
**Why it fails**: You'll run out of money before finding PMF.
**Solution**: Ensure LTV > 3x cost of onboarding, or have sufficient runway.

### Pitfall 2: Poor onboarding experience
**Why it fails**: Manual onboarding that's bad is worse than self-service.
**Solution**: Invest in training, scripts, and quality control. Make it excellent.

### Pitfall 3: Not collecting insights systematically
**Why it fails**: You waste the learning opportunity.
**Solution**: Treat onboarders as researchers. Log insights, review patterns, inform roadmap.

### Pitfall 4: Scaling the team too slowly
**Why it fails**: Wait times balloon, users churn, opportunity lost.
**Solution**: Forecast demand, hire ahead, train continuously.

### Pitfall 5: Never transitioning to self-service
**Why it fails**: Eventually hits scale ceiling, loses users who won't do manual onboarding.
**Solution**: Plan the transition from day one. Know what success looks like.

### Pitfall 6: Transitioning to self-service too early
**Why it fails**: Before product is ready, self-service activation will be terrible.
**Solution**: Wait until product is stable and you deeply understand your users.

### Pitfall 7: Forcing manual onboarding on wrong segments
**Why it fails**: Some users will never tolerate required onboarding.
**Solution**: Offer optional self-service track for users who insist.

## Real-World Examples

### Superhuman
- **Duration**: Manual onboarding from launch through Series B
- **Scale**: ~20 onboarding specialists at peak
- **Transition**: Eventually built "world-class self-service"
- **Result**: "Almost every new customer goes through self-service" today
- **Lesson**: Used capital to avoid building FTUE/growth loops before PMF

### Stripe (early days)
- Founders personally onboarded early developers
- Deep integration support
- Eventually self-service with optional support

### Segment (early days)
- Engineers helped customers install and configure
- Built relationships and learned use cases
- Informed product development

## When to Apply This Strategy

### Good candidates:
- **Complex B2B SaaS**: Requires configuration and learning
- **Behavior change products**: Email, productivity, workflow tools
- **Mission-critical tools**: Where mistakes are costly (need to get it right)
- **High LTV products**: Unit economics support human touch
- **Funded startups**: Capital available to trade for time

### Poor candidates:
- **Simple consumer apps**: Low LTV, high volume needed
- **Viral products**: Need frictionless self-service for growth
- **Self-service categories**: Users expect instant access
- **Bootstrapped companies**: Can't afford the team costs

## AI Integration Notes

### Context Signals
Trigger this SOP when:
- User is pre-PMF and asking about onboarding strategy
- User mentions activation or retention challenges
- User has capital and complex product
- User is debating investing in FTUE vs. manual onboarding

### Adaptation Guidance
- **For B2B**: Often makes sense, especially for complex products
- **For consumer**: Rarely makes sense unless very high LTV
- **For marketplace**: May apply to supply side only
- **For PLG**: Conflicts with PLG motion; use for enterprise tier only

### Diagnostic Questions
1. What's your target user's LTV?
2. How complex is your product's learning curve?
3. Do you have capital to fund an onboarding team?
4. Are you pre-PMF or post-PMF?
5. What % of engineering is spent on FTUE/activation vs. core product?

### Output Format
When applying this SOP, provide:
1. Economic analysis (LTV vs. cost of manual onboarding)
2. Onboarding experience design
3. Team sizing and hiring plan
4. Metrics to track
5. Transition criteria and timeline
