# Product-Market Fit Measurement (The Superhuman Method)

## Metadata
- **Source**: Rahul Vohra (Founder & CEO, Superhuman) - Lenny's Podcast
- **Domain**: Product Management
- **Type**: Framework
- **Applicable To**: Product Managers, Founders, Growth Teams
- **Difficulty**: Intermediate
- **Company Stage**: Pre-PMF to Series A

## Overview
A systematic framework for measuring, optimizing, and systematically increasing product-market fit using the Sean Ellis test (40% very disappointed threshold) combined with user segmentation to create an algorithmic roadmap guaranteed to increase PMF.

## When to Use
- You're trying to determine if you've achieved product-market fit
- You need to prioritize your product roadmap based on PMF data
- You want to systematically improve your PMF score
- You're unsure which user feedback to act on

## Prerequisites
- At least 30-100 active users who have used your product
- Ability to survey your user base
- Product hypothesis about your core value proposition
- Understanding of your target user segment

## Procedure

### Step 1: Measure Product-Market Fit with the Sean Ellis Test

Ask your users one primary question:
**"How would you feel if you could no longer use this product?"**

Provide three response options:
1. Very disappointed
2. Somewhat disappointed
3. Not disappointed

**PMF Threshold**: Companies that struggle to grow have less than 40% "very disappointed." Companies that grow fastest have more than 40% "very disappointed."

**Why This Works**: This metric is far more predictive of success than Net Promoter Score or other vanity metrics. It measures genuine dependency and love for your product.

### Step 2: Segment Users by Disappointment Level

Classify your users into three groups based on their response:
- **Very Disappointed**: Already love your product
- **Somewhat Disappointed**: Kind of love your product, but something is holding them back
- **Not Disappointed**: Too far from loving your product (essentially a lost cause)

**Key Insight**: Focus your efforts on the "Somewhat Disappointed" segment, not the extremes.

### Step 3: Identify Your Main Benefit

Ask the "Very Disappointed" users why they love your product:
- "What is the main benefit you receive from [product]?"
- Extract the core value proposition from their responses

For Superhuman, this was:
- Speed
- Keyboard shortcuts
- Design aesthetic
- Time savings

### Step 4: Segment "Somewhat Disappointed" Users by Main Benefit Resonance

Ask the "Somewhat Disappointed" users:
**"Do you like [product] because of [main benefit] or for something else?"**

Example: "Do you like Superhuman because of its speed or for something else?"

Create two subsegments:
1. **Main Benefit Resonates**: They like the product for the same reason as your superfans
2. **Main Benefit Doesn't Resonate**: They like it for different reasons

**Critical Decision**: Politely disregard feedback from users where the main benefit doesn't resonate. Even if you build everything they ask for, they're pulling you in a different direction from your core value proposition.

### Step 5: Identify What's Holding Back the Target Segment

Ask the "Somewhat Disappointed + Main Benefit Resonates" users:
**"What is the ONE thing holding you back from getting more value from [product]?"**

or

**"What type of person do you think would most benefit from [product]?"** (This reveals gaps)

This generates your list of objections to overcome.

### Step 6: Identify What to Double Down On

Ask your "Very Disappointed" users:
**"What would you most like us to improve or add to [product]?"**

This tells you what features or qualities to amplify.

### Step 7: Build Your Algorithmic Roadmap

At the start of every planning cycle, allocate resources:

**50% of engineering time**: Double down on what people really love (from Step 6)
**50% of engineering time**: Systematically overcome objections of the "Somewhat Disappointed + Main Benefit Resonates" segment (from Step 5)

**Result**: This roadmap is guaranteed to increase your PMF score because:
- You're strengthening what already works
- You're converting warm users (not cold users) into superfans
- You're ignoring users who would pull you off-strategy

### Step 8: Re-measure Quarterly

Run the same survey every quarter to:
- Track your PMF score over time
- Validate that your efforts are working
- Identify new objections as you overcome old ones
- Adjust your roadmap based on fresh data

## Expected Outcomes
- Clear numeric measure of product-market fit (% very disappointed)
- Systematic increase in PMF score over time (typically 5-15 percentage points per quarter if executing well)
- Data-driven roadmap that eliminates subjective prioritization debates
- Confidence in which user feedback to ignore vs. act on
- Faster path to sustainable growth

## Common Pitfalls

### Pitfall 1: Acting on feedback from "Not Disappointed" users
**Why it fails**: These users are too far from loving your product. Building for them dilutes your core value proposition.
**Solution**: Politely ignore this segment. They may become relevant later as you expand, but not during the PMF phase.

### Pitfall 2: Only listening to your biggest fans
**Why it fails**: Your superfans already love you. Building only for them doesn't expand your market.
**Solution**: Focus on the "Somewhat Disappointed + Main Benefit Resonates" segment to convert warm users into superfans.

### Pitfall 3: Acting on all "Somewhat Disappointed" feedback
**Why it fails**: Some of these users want your product to be something fundamentally different.
**Solution**: Only act on feedback from users where your main benefit resonates.

### Pitfall 4: Changing survey methodology mid-stream
**Why it fails**: All historical data becomes invalid; you lose trend visibility.
**Solution**: Pick one method (email, in-product, etc.) and stick with it. If you must change, start fresh with a new baseline.

### Pitfall 5: Surveying too few users
**Why it fails**: Results aren't statistically significant and can be misleading.
**Solution**: Aim for at least 30-40 responses, ideally 100+ for stable measurements.

### Pitfall 6: Not re-measuring regularly
**Why it fails**: You lose visibility into whether your roadmap is actually working.
**Solution**: Set a quarterly cadence for re-measuring and reviewing the data.

## Real-World Example (Superhuman)

**Initial State**:
- Unclear which features to prioritize
- Diverse user feedback pulling in many directions
- Needed systematic approach to reach PMF

**After Implementing Framework**:
- Discovered 40%+ "very disappointed" threshold
- Identified "speed" as the main benefit that resonated
- Segmented out users who wanted a different product (e.g., CRM features)
- Focused on users who valued speed but had specific objections (mobile app, Windows support, etc.)
- Systematically increased PMF score by alternating between doubling down on speed and overcoming objections

## AI Integration Notes

### Context Signals
Trigger this SOP when:
- User asks "how do I know if I have product-market fit?"
- User is struggling with feature prioritization
- User mentions conflicting feedback from different user segments
- User is pre-growth stage trying to find PMF

### Adaptation Guidance
- For very early stage (less than 30 users): Recommend qualitative conversations instead of surveys
- For established products: Can apply to specific features or modules, not just whole product
- For B2B products: May need to segment by company size or vertical before applying framework
- For consumer products: Ensure sufficient sample size (100+ responses minimum)

### Edge Cases
- If less than 30% "very disappointed": May indicate fundamental product-market mismatch; consider pivot
- If more than 70% "very disappointed": Focus may need to shift from PMF to growth and scale
- If "main benefit" varies widely: May indicate positioning problem or too broad of a target market

### Output Format
When applying this SOP, structure the guidance as:
1. Survey question templates
2. Segmentation decision tree
3. Roadmap prioritization framework
4. Re-measurement schedule
