- **Company Stage**: Seed to Growth stage

## Overview
A strategic framework for positioning speed and performance as your primary product differentiator, making it a core feature rather than a technical concern. This approach helped Superhuman compete against incumbents and create a remarkable, shareable product experience.

## When to Use
- You're competing against large, established incumbents
- You're looking for a clear, defensible positioning
- You want to create word-of-mouth growth
- Your target users complain that existing solutions are "slow"
- You need a positioning that reinforces your product strategy

## Prerequisites
- Customer research showing performance pain points
- Engineering capability to deliver on speed promises
- Understanding of incumbent's technical constraints
- Willingness to make speed a top-level priority

## Core Insight

"Almost no software has been sold on the value proposition of speed since Google Chrome launched."

Speed is an available, unique, and compelling position that:
- Resonates deeply with users (emotional response)
- Is defensible (hard for incumbents to copy)
- Is measurable (can be benchmarked and proven)
- Creates word-of-mouth ("it's really fucking fast")
- Enables premium pricing (time is money)

## Procedure

### Step 1: Validate Speed as a Position (Before Committing)

Research whether speed is a viable position for your product.

**Interview 100-200+ potential customers**:

Ask about their current solution:
1. "What do you like about [incumbent product]?"
2. "What frustrates you about [incumbent product]?"
3. "If you could improve one thing, what would it be?"

**Look for patterns**:
- Do people mention "slow," "laggy," "takes too long," or "waiting"?
- How frequently does performance come up unprompted?
- Is it a primary complaint or secondary?

**Superhuman's validation**:
- Almost everyone said email took too much time
- Many people specifically said Gmail/Outlook were too slow
- Strong emotional language around this pain point

**Decision criteria**: If 30%+ of users mention speed/performance as a top-3 issue, it's worth considering as your position.

### Step 2: Test If the Position Is Unique and Available

**Ask yourself**:

1. **Is the position unique?**
   - Are competitors selling on speed?
   - Is any recent product known primarily for performance?
   - Can you own this position?

2. **Is the position available?**
   - Has anyone successfully claimed "fastest" in your category?
   - Are there technical/brand reasons you can't claim this?

**Superhuman's analysis**:
- ✅ No email client positioned on speed since early Gmail
- ✅ Chrome had successfully done it in browsers (proof of concept)
- ✅ No one else claiming this position
- ✅ Available and ownable

### Step 3: Verify Speed Reinforces Your Product Strategy

**Critical question**: "Does speed support what we're trying to build strategically?"

**Strategic advantages of speed positioning**:

1. **Competitive moat against incumbents**:
   - Large companies have entrenched, slow architecture
   - Scale makes optimization harder
   - Legacy code creates technical debt
   - Difficult to refactor while maintaining features

2. **Clear product principles**:
   - Every feature must be fast
   - No feature ships if it slows things down
   - Creates objective quality bar

3. **Supports premium pricing**:
   - Time savings are quantifiable ROI
   - Professionals value their time highly
   - Justifies paying for something with free alternatives

**Superhuman's strategic fit**:
- Gmail and Outlook couldn't easily get faster (massive scale, legacy code)
- Speed required top-to-bottom architectural decisions (moat)
- Enabled premium pricing ($30/month for email)
- Created clear decision framework for features

### Step 4: Conduct the "Cocktail Party Test"

Before fully committing, observe how early users describe your product to others.

**The test**:
- Give your product to beta users
- Watch/listen to how they pitch it to friends and colleagues
- Note the language they use unprompted

**What to listen for**:
- Emotional language ("love it," "amazing," "incredible")
- Specific mentions of speed
- Simple, memorable phrases
- Eagerness to demo or share

**Superhuman's result**:
- Users consistently said: "Dude, you have to use it, it's really fucking fast."
- Simple, memorable, emotional
- Natural word-of-mouth pitch
- Validated speed as the position

**Success criteria**: If users naturally lead with your proposed position when describing your product, you've found your angle.

### Step 5: Define Your Speed Standards

Make speed measurable and set specific targets.

**Superhuman's standards**:
- Every interaction must be faster than 100ms
- Average response time: <50ms
- No perceptible lag on any action
- App launch: <1 second

**How to set your standards**:

1. **Research perception thresholds**:
   - <100ms = Instantaneous
   - 100-300ms = Perceptible but still fast
   - 300ms-1s = Noticeable delay
   - >1s = Slow, attention wanders

2. **Benchmark competitors**:
   - Measure incumbent performance
   - Identify where users feel pain
   - Set targets significantly better

3. **Define what counts**:
   - Which interactions must be fast?
   - What can be async/background?
   - What's visible to user vs. backend?

4. **Make it measurable**:
   - Instrument everything
   - Monitor in production
   - Alert when performance degrades
   - Review metrics regularly

### Step 6: Make Speed a Top-Level Product Principle

Embed speed into your culture and decision-making.

**Operationalize speed**:

1. **Make it a company value**:
   - "Deliver remarkable quality" (Superhuman value)
   - "Build the extraordinary" (Superhuman value)
   - Referenced in every product review

2. **Gate feature launches on performance**:
   - No feature ships if it breaks speed standards
   - Performance is not optional
   - Tech debt that affects speed is high priority

3. **Allocate engineering time**:
   - Dedicated performance optimization sprints
   - Every engineer owns performance
   - Performance is part of definition of done

4. **Measure continuously**:
   - Real user monitoring (RUM)
   - Performance dashboards
   - Regression alerts
   - Regular performance audits

5. **Celebrate speed wins**:
   - Share performance improvements
   - Highlight speed in release notes
   - Make heroes of engineers who optimize

### Step 7: Market Your Speed Advantage

Make speed central to your positioning and messaging.

**Marketing approaches**:

1. **Quantify the benefit**:
   - "2x faster at email"
   - "Save 4 hours per week"
   - "Respond 1-2 days faster"
   - Numbers make it concrete

2. **Demonstrate, don't just claim**:
   - Show side-by-side comparisons
   - Let users experience it in trials
   - Use video to highlight speed
   - Free demo/trials are critical

3. **Create memorable comparisons**:
   - Chrome: "Faster than a lightning strike"
   - Be creative and visual
   - Make it shareable

4. **Collect and share testimonials about speed**:
   - Users saying "fast" unprompted
   - Screenshots of praise
   - Social proof of speed benefit

5. **Make it visible in product**:
   - Show time saved
   - Display speed metrics
   - Highlight performance in UI

**Example from Superhuman**:
- Pitch: "The fastest email experience ever made"
- Proof: Before/after metrics (2x faster, 4 hours saved/week)
- Experience: Instant trial shows rather than tells
- Result: Word-of-mouth includes speed as primary descriptor

### Step 8: Protect Your Speed Moat

Continuously invest in maintaining and extending your performance advantage.

**Ongoing commitments**:

1. **Resist feature bloat**:
   - Every new feature must maintain speed
   - Remove features that slow things down
   - Say no to heavy integrations

2. **Invest in infrastructure**:
   - Modern stack choices
   - Regular refactoring
   - Technical debt management
   - Performance tooling

3. **Architectural decisions for speed**:
   - Caching strategies
   - Optimistic UI updates
   - Prefetching and prediction
   - Backend performance

4. **Monitor competitive landscape**:
   - Are competitors catching up?
   - Do you need to raise the bar?
   - What's the new threshold for "fast"?

5. **Evolve the definition**:
   - As tech improves, so should your standards
   - Stay ahead of user expectations
   - Push boundaries

## Expected Outcomes
- Clear, differentiated positioning in market
- Strong word-of-mouth growth ("you have to try it, it's so fast")
- Premium pricing power (speed = time saved = ROI)
- Defensible competitive moat (hard for incumbents to copy)
- Engaged users who feel more productive
- Higher user satisfaction and retention
- Recruitment advantage (engineers want to work on fast products)

## Common Pitfalls

### Pitfall 1: Claiming speed without delivering it
**Why it fails**: Users immediately know if you're slow. Credibility destroyed.
**Solution**: Only position on speed once you've actually built it. Let users experience it.

### Pitfall 2: Letting performance degrade over time
**Why it fails**: Death by a thousand cuts. Each feature adds a bit of lag until you're not fast anymore.
**Solution**: Make performance a non-negotiable part of every release. Set up alerts and monitoring.

### Pitfall 3: Sacrificing functionality for speed
**Why it fails**: A fast product that doesn't work is useless.
**Solution**: Speed enhances function; it doesn't replace it. Build the functionality first, then make it fast.

### Pitfall 4: Not measuring or proving the speed advantage
**Why it fails**: Users won't believe claims without evidence or experience.
**Solution**: Instrument everything, publish benchmarks, offer free trials, show metrics in product.

### Pitfall 5: Picking speed as a position without user validation
**Why it fails**: If users don't care about speed in your category, it won't resonate.
**Solution**: Always validate through user research first (Step 1).

### Pitfall 6: Positioning on speed when your product is mission-critical
**Why it fails**: For some products (email, banking), reliability matters more than speed.
**Solution**: Position on both: "Fast AND reliable" or "Fast without compromising security."

### Pitfall 7: Thinking speed is just an engineering problem
**Why it fails**: Speed must be a company-wide priority to maintain.
**Solution**: Make it a top-level value, involve design and product, allocate resources.

## Speed vs. Other Positions

When is speed the right position?

| Choose Speed When | Choose Something Else When |
|-------------------|---------------------------|
| Incumbents are slow | Incumbents are already fast |
| Users mention speed pain | Users don't complain about speed |
| You can measure the delta | Speed is table stakes |
| Your architecture enables it | You have different advantages |
| Time saved = clear ROI | Other benefits more valuable |

## AI Integration Notes

### Context Signals
Trigger this SOP when:
- User asks about product positioning strategy
- User is competing against large incumbents
- User mentions users complain about slow incumbents
- User asks how to differentiate their product
- User is designing a new product in a crowded category

### Adaptation Guidance
- **For B2B products**: Emphasize time saved = money saved (ROI)
- **For consumer products**: Focus on emotional benefit and delight
- **For marketplaces**: Speed may apply to matching, transactions, or both sides
- **For developer tools**: Speed is often table stakes; may need to combine with other positions

### Diagnostic Questions
1. Do potential users complain that existing solutions are slow?
2. Are incumbents technically constrained from getting faster?
3. Can you build something demonstrably faster?
4. Does speed support your broader product strategy?
5. Do users mention speed when describing your product to others?

### Edge Cases
- **When speed is table stakes**: In some categories, everyone is already fast. Speed alone won't differentiate.
- **When reliability matters more**: For critical infrastructure, position on reliability + speed.
- **When features matter more**: Some users will choose feature-rich over fast.
- **When speed compromises quality**: Never sacrifice core functionality for speed.

### Output Format
When applying this SOP, provide:
1. User research validation (do users care about speed?)
2. Competitive analysis (is the position available?)
3. Strategic fit assessment (does it reinforce your strategy?)
4. Specific speed standards to set
5. Go-to-market approach for positioning
