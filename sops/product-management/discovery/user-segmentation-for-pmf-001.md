## Overview
A framework for deliberately deciding which early users to listen to and which to ignore when building toward product-market fit. This approach helps you avoid the trap of trying to please everyone while still building what people want.

## When to Use
- You're receiving conflicting feedback from different user segments
- You need to decide which feature requests to prioritize
- You're trying to achieve product-market fit without diluting your value proposition
- You have diverse early users with different needs and motivations

## Prerequisites
- Product-Market Fit measurement data (Sean Ellis survey results)
- Clear understanding of your core value proposition
- List of user feedback and feature requests
- Ability to survey or interview users

## Procedure

### Step 1: Establish Your Core Value Proposition

Identify what your superfans (the "Very Disappointed" segment) love most about your product.

Ask them:
- "What is the main benefit you receive from [product]?"
- "Why do you love this product?"
- "What would be lost if this product disappeared?"

Extract themes from their responses. For Superhuman, this was:
- **Primary**: Speed
- **Secondary**: Keyboard shortcuts, design aesthetic, time savings

**Output**: Your "Main Benefit" - the core reason people love your product.

### Step 2: Create the Segmentation Matrix

Divide all users into a 2x3 matrix based on two dimensions:

**Dimension 1: Disappointment Level** (from Sean Ellis test)
- Very Disappointed
- Somewhat Disappointed
- Not Disappointed

**Dimension 2: Main Benefit Resonance** (from follow-up question)
- Main benefit resonates (they like your product for your core value prop)
- Main benefit doesn't resonate (they like it for other reasons)

This creates 6 segments:

| Segment | Disappointment | Main Benefit | Action |
|---------|---------------|--------------|--------|
| A | Very Disappointed | Resonates | Already converted - Learn from them |
| B | Very Disappointed | Doesn't Resonate | Monitor but don't prioritize |
| C | Somewhat Disappointed | **Resonates** | **PRIMARY FOCUS** |
| D | Somewhat Disappointed | Doesn't Resonate | Politely ignore |
| E | Not Disappointed | Resonates | Too far away - Ignore for now |
| F | Not Disappointed | Doesn't Resonate | Wrong audience - Ignore |

### Step 3: Focus on Segment C (Somewhat Disappointed + Main Benefit Resonates)

This is your golden segment because:
1. They already understand and value your core proposition
2. Something relatively small is holding them back
3. Converting them won't require fundamental product changes
4. They represent your near-term growth opportunity

Ask Segment C:
- "What is holding you back from getting more value from [product]?"
- "What's the ONE thing we could improve that would make you love this product?"
- "What concerns do you have about [product]?"

### Step 4: Deliberately Ignore Segment D (Somewhat Disappointed + Main Benefit Doesn't Resonate)

**This is the hardest but most important decision.**

These users seem close to loving your product, but they want it to be something fundamentally different.

**Example from Superhuman**:
- Some early users wanted Superhuman to be a CRM
- They liked the product, but not for its speed
- Even if Superhuman built everything they asked for, they'd still be pulling the company away from "the fastest email experience"

**Rule**: Politely disregard feedback from this segment. They are pulling you in a different strategic direction.

**How to politely ignore**:
- Thank them for the feedback
- Don't promise to build their requests
- Optionally suggest alternative products that better fit their needs
- Don't argue or over-explain your decision

### Step 5: Learn from Segment A (Very Disappointed + Main Benefit Resonates)

These are your superfans. Use them to:
- Understand what to double down on
- Identify what makes your product magical
- Test new features that amplify your main benefit
- Generate word-of-mouth and testimonials

Ask Segment A:
- "What should we improve or add to make this product even better?"
- "What do you love most about [product]?"
- "What would make you recommend this to others even more?"

### Step 6: Apply the "Can't Be All People" Filter

**Core Principle**: "You have to deliberately not act on the feedback of many of your early users. You can't make something that all people want. It has to be something that some people want."

For every piece of feedback, ask:
1. Which segment does this user belong to?
2. Does this feedback align with our main benefit?
3. Will building this help convert Segment C (our target)?

If the answer to #3 is no, don't build it - no matter how loud or numerous the requests.

### Step 7: Create Segment-Specific Communication Strategies

**For Segment C (Target)**:
- Regular updates on features addressing their objections
- Early access to new features
- Proactive outreach for feedback

**For Segment D (Ignore)**:
- Polite acknowledgment of feedback
- Transparent communication that this isn't your current focus
- Suggestions for alternative products when appropriate

**For Segments E & F (Not Disappointed)**:
- Minimal engagement
- Standard support but no special attention
- No roadmap adjustments based on their feedback

### Step 8: Re-segment Quarterly

As your product evolves:
- Users move between segments
- New objections emerge as old ones are overcome
- Your main benefit may expand or evolve

Re-run your segmentation analysis quarterly to:
- Track segment migration
- Identify new Segment C priorities
- Validate your strategic focus

## Expected Outcomes
- Clear decision framework for which feedback to act on
- Reduced feature bloat from trying to please everyone
- Faster progress toward product-market fit
- Stronger product differentiation (by not being everything to everyone)
- More efficient use of engineering resources
- Increased conversion of warm users to superfans

## Common Pitfalls

### Pitfall 1: Trying to convert everyone
**Why it fails**: Different segments need fundamentally different products. Trying to serve all of them dilutes your value proposition.
**Solution**: Accept that you will deliberately ignore some users. This is a feature, not a bug.

### Pitfall 2: Feeling bad about ignoring feedback
**Why it fails**: Emotional attachment to "listening to users" can lead to building the wrong things.
**Solution**: Remember that ignoring some users is how you build something great for the right users. You're not being rude; you're being strategic.

### Pitfall 3: Miscategorizing segment D as segment C
**Why it fails**: You waste resources building features that don't strengthen your core value proposition.
**Solution**: Always ask the "main benefit" question. If their answer doesn't align with your superfans, they're segment D.

### Pitfall 4: Ignoring all "Somewhat Disappointed" users
**Why it fails**: Segment C is your growth engine. Ignoring them means no PMF progress.
**Solution**: Distinguish between Segment C (main benefit resonates) and Segment D (doesn't resonate). Very different strategies.

### Pitfall 5: Never re-segmenting
**Why it fails**: User needs evolve, segments shift, and you miss changes in your market.
**Solution**: Re-segment quarterly as part of your PMF measurement routine.

### Pitfall 6: Announcing who you're ignoring
**Why it fails**: Creates negative PR and alienates users unnecessarily.
**Solution**: Politely acknowledge all feedback but quietly prioritize based on segmentation. No need to publicly explain your strategy.

## Real-World Example (Superhuman)

**Challenge**: Early Superhuman users were diverse:
- Some wanted email + CRM functionality
- Some wanted the fastest possible email experience
- Some wanted collaboration features
- Some wanted advanced filtering and automation

**Segmentation Discovery**:
- Superfans loved Superhuman for **speed** and **keyboard shortcuts**
- Some "Somewhat Disappointed" users liked the product but wanted CRM features (Segment D - ignore)
- Other "Somewhat Disappointed" users loved the speed but needed mobile app or Windows support (Segment C - focus here)

**Decision**:
- Deliberately ignored CRM feature requests (even though users were vocal)
- Focused on users who valued speed but had platform objections
- Built iOS, Android, Windows, and Mac apps
- Result: Increased PMF score by converting Segment C while maintaining core positioning around speed

**Outcome**:
- Achieved strong product-market fit by saying "no" to many user requests
- Maintained clear positioning as "the fastest email experience"
- Grew sustainably by expanding platform support (market widening) without diluting core value (solution deepening)

## AI Integration Notes

### Context Signals
Trigger this SOP when:
- User describes conflicting feedback from different user groups
- User asks "should I build this feature?"
- User is struggling to prioritize between feature requests
- User mentions trying to make everyone happy

### Adaptation Guidance
- **For very early stage**: Start with qualitative interviews before formal segmentation
- **For B2B products**: Add firmographic segmentation (company size, industry) before applying framework
- **For marketplaces**: Apply separately to supply and demand sides
- **For platform products**: May need to segment by use case or persona before applying disappointment framework

### Edge Cases
- **No clear main benefit**: May indicate positioning problem; need to establish clear value prop first
- **Multiple equally strong main benefits**: May indicate multiple distinct user segments; consider if you're building one product or two
- **Segment C is tiny**: May indicate too narrow positioning or wrong target market
- **Segment D is huge**: Common in early days; requires discipline to ignore them despite volume

### Decision Tree for Feedback
```
New feedback arrives
├─ Is user "Very Disappointed"?
│  ├─ Yes + Main Benefit Resonates → Segment A → Consider for doubling down
│  └─ Yes + Main Benefit Doesn't Resonate → Segment B → Monitor, low priority
└─ Is user "Somewhat Disappointed"?
   ├─ Yes + Main Benefit Resonates → Segment C → HIGH PRIORITY
   ├─ Yes + Main Benefit Doesn't Resonate → Segment D → IGNORE
   └─ Not Disappointed → Segments E/F → IGNORE
```

### Output Format
When applying this SOP, provide:
1. Segmentation matrix with user counts in each cell
2. List of Segment C objections to prioritize
3. List of Segment D requests to ignore (with explanation)
4. Recommended roadmap allocation based on segments
