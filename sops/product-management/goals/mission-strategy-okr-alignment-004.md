# Mission, Strategy, and OKR Alignment Framework

## Metadata
- **Source**: Christina Wodtke - Lenny's Podcast
- **Domain**: Product Management - Goals & Strategy
- **Type**: Framework
- **Applicable To**: Founders, Product Leaders, Executives, Strategy Teams
- **Company Size**: All sizes (most critical for 20-200 employees)
- **Difficulty**: Intermediate to Advanced

## Overview
A hierarchical framework for connecting long-term mission to annual strategy to quarterly OKRs to weekly execution. This system ensures every person can answer "What am I doing this week to fulfill our mission?" while maintaining strategic flexibility. It solves the problem of OKRs existing in a vacuum, disconnected from meaningful purpose.

## When to Use
- When setting company or team direction for the year
- When OKRs feel arbitrary or disconnected from company purpose
- When teams don't understand "why" behind their goals
- When planning quarterly OKRs and need strategic context
- When mission/vision exists but doesn't drive decisions
- When strategy is vague or non-existent

## Prerequisites
- Clarity on what problem your company/team exists to solve
- Willingness to make strategic choices (say no to some opportunities)
- Leadership alignment on direction
- Time for strategic thinking (can't rush this)

## The Hierarchy: Mission → Strategy → OKRs → Weekly Work

```
MISSION (5 years)
    ↓
STRATEGY (1-2 years)
    ↓
QUARTERLY THEMES (4 quarters, half-planned)
    ↓
QUARTERLY OKRs (Current quarter, detailed)
    ↓
WEEKLY INITIATIVES (P1s that move OKRs)
    ↓
DAILY WORK
```

## Procedure

### Layer 1: Define Your Mission (5-Year Horizon)

#### Step 1: Set a Time-Bounded Mission
**Shift from "forever mission" to "5-year mission"**
- Mission doesn't need to last forever
- Making it vague so it covers everything makes it useless
- Instead: "What would we like to see happen in the next 5 years?"
- Accept that you'll evolve and change the mission later

**Example**: "Bring amazing games that delight our users and we're proud to ship into the world" (5-year game studio mission)

**Not**: "Connect people" (too vague, could mean anything)

#### Step 2: Dig Into Meaning
**Make it concrete enough to guide decisions**
- What does "delight" mean for us?
- What does "proud" mean? (Ethics, quality, innovation?)
- Who specifically are our users?
- Really talk about it; get into nitty-gritty

**Purpose**: Creates shared understanding that guides decisions

#### Step 3: Reconnect Regularly
**Mission isn't "set it and forget it"**
- Question: "How often do companies talk about their mission?" (Answer: Almost never)
- Instead: Go back to mission at each quarter
- Ask: "Why did we start this company? What did we believe would work?"
- Find "moment of meaning" and reconnect to it
- Make it real in weekly activities

**Red flag**: If leadership can't recall mission or it feels empty, rewrite it

### Layer 2: Develop Strategy (Annual Focus)

#### Step 4: Understand What Strategy Is
**Strategy = strongly held hypothesis about how to win in the market and fulfill your vision**

**Not strategy:**
- Vague statements ("We'll be the best")
- Lists of features to build
- Generic goals ("Grow revenue")

**Is strategy:**
- Specific choices about how to compete
- Hypotheses you believe will work
- Answers to: Physical or digital? B2B or B2C? Subscription or one-time? Which platform? What distribution?

**Example game company strategy:**
- "We'll launch on Apple Arcade first to build customer base and name recognition, then expand to other platforms"
- This is testable hypothesis with specific choices

**Christina's shocking discovery**: "Many companies don't seem to have any strategy whatsoever"

#### Step 5: Make Strategic Choices
**Answer key business questions:**
- How are we fulfilling our mission? By what method?
- Who is our target market and why them specifically?
- What are our distribution channels?
- How will we monetize?
- What trends are we leveraging?
- Why will we win vs. competitors?

**For product strategy specifically:**
- What user problems are we solving?
- What value are we creating?
- How will we deliver that value?
- What's our differentiation?

**Reality check**: If you can't articulate your strategy in 2-3 sentences, you don't have one

#### Step 6: Create Half-Built Annual Plan
**Map out quarterly themes without over-planning**
- Identify what each quarter should accomplish toward strategy
- Write objectives for Q1-Q4
- Do NOT write key results for future quarters yet
- Leave room for learning and adaptation

**Example: New product launch strategy**
- Q1 theme: "Figure out what it is and validate user interest"
- Q2 theme: "Get early prototypes out and validate concepts"
- Q3 theme: "Build extensively"
- Q4 theme: "Market and launch"

**Why "half-built":**
- Too much strategy ties you down (can't adapt to learning)
- Too little strategy makes you reactive to everything (chaos)
- This is the sweet spot

### Layer 3: Translate Strategy to Quarterly OKRs

#### Step 7: Extract Objective from Quarterly Theme
**Current quarter only: Go from theme to specific objective**
- Take Q1 theme: "Figure out product and validate interest"
- Turn into inspiring objective: "Have a validated product concept that excites users and is technically feasible"
- Objective manifests the strategy at one-quarter level

**Connection point**: Anyone should be able to trace from objective back to strategy back to mission

#### Step 8: Define Key Results with "How Would We Know?"
**Answer the question for this specific quarter**
- How would we know we have a validated concept?
- Brainstorm all possible measures (10 minutes)
- Pick three that triangulate: quantitative, qualitative, business

**See okr-setting-framework-001.md for detailed process**

#### Step 9: Keep Future Quarters Light
**Preserve strategic flexibility**
- Q2-Q4: Keep objectives only
- Don't write key results until that quarter approaches
- Allow for pivots based on Q1 learnings
- Key results create arguments and take time; wait until needed

### Layer 4: Connect to Weekly Execution

#### Step 10: Answer the Atomic Unit Question Every Monday
**"What am I doing THIS WEEK to get closer to our OKRs?"**

This is where the entire system comes alive:
- OKRs → derived from quarterly theme
- Quarterly theme → derived from strategy
- Strategy → derived from mission
- Therefore: This week's work → contributes to mission

**The cascade:**
```
Mission: Delight users with games we're proud of
    ↓
Strategy: Build on Apple Arcade first for brand recognition
    ↓
Q1 Theme: Validate product concept
    ↓
Q1 OKR: Have validated concept that excites users
    ↓
This Week: Interview 10 users about prototype
    ↓
Today: Prepare interview script
```

#### Step 11: Make Alignment Visible
**Weekly status updates create alignment**
- Everyone shares: What I'm doing this week toward OKRs
- Cross-team dependencies become visible
- People can self-coordinate: "Oh, I should talk to them"
- Leaders can spot misalignment quickly

**At scale**: Google makes all OKRs and updates searchable company-wide

## Validation Checks: Is Your Alignment Working?

### Test 1: The "Why" Chain
Pick any person doing any task. Ask them:
- What are you working on?
- Why are you working on that? (Should connect to OKR)
- Why is that the OKR? (Should connect to strategy)
- Why is that the strategy? (Should connect to mission)

**If chain breaks**: Alignment failure at that level

### Test 2: The Monday Question
Every person should be able to answer clearly:
- "What am I doing this week to move us toward our goals?"

**If they can't**: OKRs aren't connected to real work

### Test 3: The Decision Filter
When faced with a decision, can team answer:
- "Does this help our OKR?"
- "Does this align with our strategy?"
- "Does this serve our mission?"

**If they can't**: Goals aren't functioning as decision-making tools

### Test 4: The Recall Test
Mid-quarter, ask team members:
- "What are our OKRs this quarter?"
- "Why these OKRs?"

**If they can't recall**: Alignment system isn't working; goals aren't top-of-mind

## Expected Outcomes
- Every person can connect their weekly work to company mission
- Strategic choices are clear and guide decisions
- OKRs feel meaningful, not arbitrary
- Teams can make autonomous decisions aligned with strategy
- Less need for leadership approval on every decision
- Stronger sense of purpose and motivation
- Ability to evaluate new opportunities ("Does this fit our strategy?")
- Learning compounds: Each quarter builds on strategic knowledge

## Common Pitfalls

### Pitfall 1: Mission Too Vague to Be Useful
**Problem**: "Connect people" or "Make the world better"—could mean anything
**Impact**: Doesn't guide decisions; teams still don't know what to do
**Solution**: Add specificity and time-bound it (5 years)
**Example fix**: "Connect people" → "Enable remote teams to collaborate as effectively as in-person teams over the next 5 years"

### Pitfall 2: No Actual Strategy
**Problem**: Calling goals or features "strategy"
**Test**: Can you articulate your hypothesis about how to win?
**Solution**: Do the hard work of making strategic choices
**Resources**: Study Hamilton Helmer (7 Powers), April Dunford (Positioning), Ravi Mehta (Product Strategy Stack)

### Pitfall 3: OKRs Not Derived from Strategy
**Problem**: OKRs set in a vacuum or bottom-up without strategic context
**Impact**: Teams work hard on things that don't matter
**Solution**: Always start strategy discussion before OKR planning

### Pitfall 4: Over-Planning Future Quarters
**Problem**: Writing detailed OKRs for Q2-Q4 at start of year
**Impact**: Can't adapt to learning; wasted planning time
**Solution**: Objectives only for future quarters; key results when you get there

### Pitfall 5: Strategy Exists But Nobody Knows It
**Problem**: Leadership has strategy, doesn't communicate it
**Impact**: Teams set OKRs that conflict with strategy
**Solution**:
- Share strategy document widely
- Discuss in all-hands
- Reference in OKR planning sessions
- Make it searchable/accessible

### Pitfall 6: Mission Disconnect
**Problem**: Mission statement exists, never referenced, doesn't drive decisions
**Impact**: Work feels meaningless; team doesn't know "why"
**Solution**:
- Reconnect to mission at start of each quarter
- Reference mission in OKR planning
- Tell stories about how work connects to mission
- If mission feels empty, rewrite it

### Pitfall 7: Weekly Work Drifts from OKRs
**Problem**: Good planning, but execution doesn't follow through
**Impact**: OKRs are theoretical; real work is whatever's urgent
**Solution**:
- Monday commitments ritual (see okr-cadence-rituals-002.md)
- Ask weekly: "What am I doing toward OKRs?"
- Make this question non-negotiable

### Pitfall 8: Bottom-Up OKRs Without Top-Down Context
**Problem**: Telling teams "Set your OKRs" without giving strategic direction
**Impact**: Misalignment, conflicting priorities, wasted effort
**Solution**:
- Leadership sets company OKR first
- Provides strategic context
- Teams set OKRs that ladder up to company direction

## AI Integration Notes

### Context Signals for This SOP
Trigger this framework when users mention:
- "How do OKRs relate to strategy?"
- "Our OKRs feel disconnected from mission"
- "We have a vision but don't know how to translate to goals"
- "Should we do top-down or bottom-up OKRs?"
- "How do mission, vision, strategy, and OKRs fit together?"
- "Setting annual or quarterly strategy"

### Adaptation Guidance
- **Startups (<20 people)**: Mission and strategy might be founder's vision; make it explicit
- **Small teams (20-50)**: All hands on deck; everyone should understand full strategy
- **Medium (50-200)**: Each function/team has sub-strategy laddering to company strategy
- **Large (200+)**: Business units may have own missions; need clear cascade

### Critical Connections (Don't Break)
1. **Mission → Strategy**: Strategy must clearly serve mission
2. **Strategy → OKRs**: OKRs must derive from strategic choices
3. **OKRs → Weekly Work**: Monday question connects execution to goals
4. **All levels → Decision Making**: Every level should filter decisions

### Common Failure Mode
**Scenario**: Company has all four layers (mission, strategy, OKRs, work) but they're not connected
**Diagnosis**: Can draw boxes but can't draw arrows between them
**Fix**: Use the "Why" chain test; fix broken links

### Edge Cases
- **Multiple business units**: Each unit has own strategy → OKRs; company has overarching mission
- **Platform teams**: Strategy about enabling product teams; OKRs measure adoption/impact on product teams
- **Agencies/Services**: Mission about client outcomes; strategy about how to deliver; OKRs per client or capability
- **Non-profits**: Mission is primary (the whole point); strategy about impact; OKRs measure outcomes for beneficiaries
