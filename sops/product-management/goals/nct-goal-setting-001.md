# NCT Goal Setting Framework (Frontier of Understanding)

## Metadata
- **Source**: Ravi Mehta - Lenny's Podcast
- **Domain**: Product Management / Goals
- **Type**: Framework SOP
- **Applicable To**: Product Managers, Product Leaders
- **Company Stage**: All stages
- **Difficulty**: Intermediate

## Overview
The NCT (Narrative, Commitments, Tasks) framework addresses a core problem with OKRs: always committing to outcomes even when you don't know how to achieve them. The key insight: **your goal type should match your "frontier of understanding" — where your knowledge ends and uncertainty begins**.

## When to Use
- Quarterly/annual planning
- Setting team goals
- Diagnosing why goals aren't being met
- Calibrating expectations with leadership
- After missing goals repeatedly

## Prerequisites
- Honest assessment of what you know
- Understanding of uncertainty vs. execution gaps
- Leadership willing to accept non-outcome goals

## Core Concept: The Frontier of Understanding

### What is the Frontier?
The junction between what you know and what you don't know.

**Beyond the frontier:**
- Uncertainty about what works
- Hypothesis not validated
- Experiments not run
- Unknown unknowns

**Within the frontier:**
- Validated approaches
- Proven levers
- Understood causation
- Predictable outcomes

### The Problem with Always-Outcome Goals
**Standard approach:**
"We need to improve retention by 10%."

**What happens:**
- Team brainstorms experiments
- Throws spaghetti at wall
- Some might stick
- No understanding of why
- Can't repeat success

**Better approach:**
Match goal type to where you are on the understanding spectrum.

## The Four Types of Risk/Goals

### 1. Understanding Risk
**When you're here:** You don't know what moves the metric.

**Signs:**
- "We can brainstorm 10 experiments"
- "We don't really know why people retain"
- "We're guessing at levers"

**Right goal:** Increase understanding
- Goal: "Identify top 3 retention drivers through research"
- Goal: "Form validated hypothesis for what affects retention"

**Not:** "Improve retention 10%"

### 2. Dependency Risk
**When you're here:** You have hypothesis but lack tools/resources.

**Signs:**
- "We think X affects retention"
- "But we can't measure X"
- "We need to build instrumentation first"

**Right goal:** Resolve dependencies
- Goal: "Build retention tracking dashboard"
- Goal: "Implement event tracking for key flows"

**Not:** "Improve retention 10%"

### 3. Execution Risk
**When you're here:** You have hypothesis and tools, but haven't proven execution.

**Signs:**
- "We know what to build"
- "We have resources"
- "We haven't shipped this type of thing before"

**Right goal:** Prove execution capability
- Goal: "Run 20 experiments this quarter"
- Goal: "Ship three retention-focused features"

**Not yet:** "Improve retention 10%"

### 4. Strategic Risk
**When you're here:** You have hypothesis, tools, execution — but hypothesis might be wrong.

**Signs:**
- "We believe X drives retention"
- "We can execute on X"
- "But we haven't proven X → retention"

**Right goal:** Validate strategy
- Goal: "Validate that X improves retention"
- Goal: "Improve retention 10% (with specific plan)"

## Procedure

### Step 1: Map Your Frontier
Honestly assess where you are.

**For each key metric, ask:**

| Question | Yes | No |
|----------|-----|-----|
| Do we know what levers affect this? | → | Understanding risk |
| Do we have tools to act on levers? | → | Dependency risk |
| Can we execute experiments/features? | → | Execution risk |
| Is our hypothesis likely correct? | → | Strategic risk |

**Go until you hit the first "No" — that's your frontier.**

### Step 2: Match Goal Type to Frontier
Set appropriate goals for your position.

| Frontier Position | Goal Type | Example |
|-------------------|-----------|---------|
| Understanding risk | Learning goal | "Identify top retention drivers" |
| Dependency risk | Capability goal | "Build experimentation platform" |
| Execution risk | Output goal | "Run 20 retention experiments" |
| Strategic risk | Outcome goal | "Improve retention 10%" |

### Step 3: Communicate the Journey
Help leadership understand your position.

**Template:**
> "We want to improve retention. Currently, we're at [frontier position]. Our goal this quarter is [appropriate goal], which will move us toward being able to commit to outcome goals next quarter."

**Example:**
> "We want to improve retention. Currently, we don't know what drives retention (understanding risk). Our goal this quarter is to identify the top 3 retention drivers through user research and data analysis. Next quarter, we'll be able to set specific retention improvement targets."

### Step 4: Progress Through the Frontier
Sequence toward outcome goals.

**Typical progression:**
1. Q1: Understanding goal → Learn levers
2. Q2: Dependency goal → Build tools
3. Q3: Execution goal → Prove capability
4. Q4: Outcome goal → Drive results

**Key insight:** This isn't slower — it's more reliable. Skipping steps leads to missed goals and no learning.

### Step 5: Use the 2x2 for Reflection
Evaluate goal achievement.

| | Know Why | Don't Know Why |
|---|----------|----------------|
| Hit Goal | Ideal | Lucky (temporary) |
| Missed Goal | Learning | Lost |

**Goal:** Upper-left quadrant (hit goal + know why)

**Warning sign:** Upper-right (hit goal + don't know why) — can't repeat success.

## Handling "Outcome-Only" Cultures

**When leadership demands outcome goals:**

1. **Accept the outcome goal** — commit to the target
2. **Break into journey** — understanding → execution → outcome
3. **Track learning** — document what you learn each phase
4. **Reframe misses** — "We missed goal, but here's what we learned and our path forward"

**Key conversation:**
> "Leadership is always going to be outcome driven, but they also want confidence that we're going to hit those outcomes. If you can clearly convey the learning and provide a really clear path, they're often much more open than you anticipate."

## Expected Outcomes
- More realistic goals
- Higher goal achievement
- Compounding learning
- Better leadership trust
- Sustainable results

## Common Pitfalls

### Always setting outcome goals
- "Improve X by Y%"
- Regardless of understanding
- Leads to hope-based execution
- No compounding learning

### Not progressing the frontier
- Stuck at understanding forever
- "We're still learning"
- Must move toward outcomes
- Learning should unlock action

### Hiding behind uncertainty
- Using frontier as excuse
- Not pushing toward outcomes
- Legitimate frontier ≠ avoiding commitment
- Be honest about where you really are

### Not communicating frontier position
- Leadership expects outcomes
- You know you can't commit
- Silence leads to missed expectations
- Communicate your position clearly

## AI Integration Notes

### Context signals that should trigger this SOP:
- Repeated missed goals
- "We don't know what moves this metric"
- OKR frustration
- Goal-setting discussions

### How to apply:
- Help identify frontier position
- Suggest appropriate goal type
- Frame conversation with leadership
- Track progression through frontier

### Key insight:
The goal isn't to avoid outcome goals — it's to match goal type to what you actually know. Setting outcome goals when you're at understanding risk is setting yourself up to fail without learning.
