## Overview
A proven cadence of weekly and quarterly rituals that keep OKRs alive and actionable. This system uses temporal landmarks (Mondays, Fridays, quarter-ends) to create consistent rhythms of commitment, celebration, and learning that prevent OKRs from becoming "set it and forget it" documents.

## When to Use
- When implementing OKRs for the first time
- When existing OKRs feel disconnected from daily work
- When teams lose sight of goals mid-quarter
- When you need to build accountability without micromanagement
- When trying to create a learning organization

## Prerequisites
- Established OKRs for the current quarter
- Team commitment to regular check-ins
- Shared communication channel (email list, Slack channel, or meeting time)
- Psychological safety for honest progress updates

## Procedure

### Weekly Rhythm: Monday Commitments

#### Step 1: Monday Morning OKR Review (Individual Level)
**Every Monday, each person reviews their OKRs**
- Look at your OKRs first thing Monday morning
- Ask: "What am I doing THIS WEEK to move the ball forward?"
- This is the atomic unit of OKRs: connecting weekly action to quarterly goals
- Write down 3 P1 (Priority 1) initiatives for the week
  - You cannot have more than 3 P1s
  - P2s and P3s are fine for secondary work
  - P1s must connect to OKRs

**Format for Monday commitment:**
```
Current confidence in Key Results:
- KR1: [0-100% confidence + brief reason]
- KR2: [0-100% confidence + brief reason]
- KR3: [0-100% confidence + brief reason]

What I did last week:
- [Accomplishment 1]
- [Accomplishment 2]
- [What blocked me or why I failed to complete X]

What I'm doing this week (P1s only):
- [Initiative 1 - connects to KR X]
- [Initiative 2 - connects to KR Y]
- [Initiative 3 - connects to KR Z]
```

**The power of "What blocked me":**
- Creates invaluable learning: Did you get sick? Did someone not cooperate? Missing critical database?
- Tracking blockers reveals systemic issues
- Pattern recognition on what stops progress

#### Step 2: Share Status Widely
**Publish to team or company**
- Send as email to subscribed lists OR post in dedicated Slack channel
- Make it visible beyond your immediate team if possible
- At Google: All OKRs and weekly updates are on intranet (searchable by anyone)
- Benefits:
  - Enables organic coordination: "Oh, I should talk to that person"
  - Makes cross-team dependencies visible
  - Builds shared context without meetings
  - Quick to skim: People scan, spot issues, reach out

**Alternative**: Stand-up meetings can incorporate this format
- Some engineering teams may combine with daily stand-ups
- Don't prescribe; let teams find their rhythm

#### Step 3: Leadership Skim and Connect
**For managers/leaders (5-10 minutes)**
- Quickly skim through team status updates
- Look for:
  - Who should you talk to this week?
  - Who should be connected with whom?
  - What blockers can you remove?
  - What patterns are emerging?
- Take action on insights, don't just read

### Weekly Rhythm: Friday Celebrations

#### Step 4: Friday Celebration Ritual (Team Level)
**The single most undervalued OKR practice**
- Gather team every Friday (in-person or virtual)
- Duration: 15-30 minutes
- Ask three questions:
  1. "What was the most awesome thing that happened to YOU this week?"
  2. "What's the most awesome thing that happened in [Department X]?"
  3. "What's the most awesome thing [Department Y] did this week?"

**Why this matters so much:**
- Creates sense of being part of something special
- Builds psychological safety and team cohesion
- Recognizes progress and wins (combats "never enough" feeling)
- Reinforces that incremental progress compounds
- One CEO: "We only implemented Friday celebrations (not full OKRs yet) and things already got better"

**Format options:**
- Round-robin sharing
- Slack thread where people post wins
- Dedicated "brag channel"
- In team all-hands

**Key principle**: Celebration is not optional fluff; it's essential fuel

### Quarterly Rhythm: Grading and Planning

#### Step 5: Grade OKRs (Week 11-12 of Quarter)
**Timing: Second-to-last or last week of quarter**
- Don't wait until quarter is over; grade early to inform next quarter
- For each key result, assign grade:
  - Don't obsess over precision (0.08 vs 0.7 vs 70% vs 80% - all acceptable formats)
  - Hand-wave estimates are fine for qualitative goals
  - 70-80% achievement is typical for well-calibrated stretch goals

**More important than the grade: The retrospective**
- Why did we hit or miss this key result?
- What got in our way?
- What worked well?
- What would we do differently?
- What did we learn that informs next quarter?

**The learning cycle:**
- Focus on one area (e.g., retention) for one quarter
- You don't forget that knowledge when you shift focus next quarter
- Each quarter builds on previous learnings
- Company gets smarter and more effective over time

#### Step 6: Set Next Quarter OKRs (Week 12 of Quarter or Week 1 of Next Quarter)
**Timing: Ideally last week of current quarter; max 1 week into new quarter**
- Total time investment: 4 days to 1 week maximum
- Use fast peer-review process (see OKR Setting Framework)
- Start new quarter with clear direction
- Preserve 1 week of planning, 11 weeks of execution per quarter

#### Step 7: Begin New Quarter with Momentum
**First Monday of new quarter**
- Everyone sends first weekly status email with new OKRs
- Establishes immediate connection between goals and weekly work
- Creates accountability from day one

### Monthly/Ongoing: Leadership OKR Review Meetings

#### Step 8: Management OKR Review (Weekly or Bi-Weekly)
**For leadership team or all-hands**
- Duration: 10 minutes (after first setup; 30 minutes initially)
- Review each team's OKRs:
  - What are the top 2-3 initiatives moving the needle?
  - Confidence levels on key results?
  - Any concerns or blockers?

**Keep it at the right altitude:**
- Focus on strategic questions: "Is this working? Should we try something else?"
- Don't get into IC-level tasks (that's micromanagement)
- Ask: "I've been seeing that initiative for 3 weeks. Are you going to try something different?"
- Trust teams to handle execution details

**When meetings are boring:**
- Sign your OKR process is broken
- Likely cause: Reviewing tasks instead of outcomes
- Solution: Elevate the conversation to strategic level

**Scaling benefit:**
- Leaders can set good OKRs without deciding every IC task
- Enables founder/CEO to scale beyond direct involvement
- Maintains alignment without control

## Expected Outcomes
- OKRs remain top-of-mind throughout the quarter (not forgotten after week 1)
- Weekly actions clearly connect to quarterly goals
- Regular learning cycles compound into organizational knowledge
- Blockers surface quickly and get addressed
- Team morale improves through celebration
- Estimation skills improve over time through practice
- Retrieval practice strengthens memory (learning theory benefit)
- Leaders can skim updates in minutes and take targeted action

## Common Pitfalls

### Pitfall 1: Skipping Friday Celebrations
**Problem**: Treating celebration as optional or "nice to have"
**Impact**: Team burnout, loss of motivation, diminishing returns
**Solution**: Make Friday celebrations non-negotiable; they're as important as Monday commitments
**Evidence**: CEOs report "things already changing" just from implementing celebrations

### Pitfall 2: Status Emails Become Performative Theater
**Problem**: People send updates but nobody reads them; becomes checkbox exercise
**Solution**:
- Leaders must actively skim and take action on insights
- Keep format crisp and scannable (3 P1s max)
- Make it genuinely useful for coordination, not just reporting up

**Historical lesson**: Christina had a bad status email experience at MySpace where even her boss wasn't reading them—pure waste
**Good version at Zynga**: Short, focused on OKRs, actually used for coordination

### Pitfall 3: Reviews Become Task Reports
**Problem**: Leadership meetings turn into IC-level task tracking
**Impact**: Boring meetings, micromanagement, people hate OKRs
**Solution**: Stay at strategic altitude—discuss if initiatives are working, not dictating tasks

### Pitfall 4: Letting Quarter End Without Grading
**Problem**: Rolling directly into next quarter without retrospective
**Impact**: Miss critical learning; repeat same mistakes
**Solution**: Make retrospective more important than precise grading; focus on "why" and "what we learned"

### Pitfall 5: Over-Engineering the Cadence
**Problem**: Adding too many ceremonies, templates, check-ins
**Impact**: Process overhead crushes actual work
**Solution**: Start with Monday commitments + Friday celebrations; add more only if needed

### Pitfall 6: Using It for Performance Reviews
**Problem**: OKRs become about individual assessment rather than learning
**Impact**: Sandbagging, loss of stretch goals, fear of honesty
**Solution**: Decouple OKRs from comp/performance reviews; Spotify does quarterly performance conversations separately for a reason

### Pitfall 7: No Clear Owner for Maintaining Cadence
**Problem**: Rituals slip when nobody champions them
**Impact**: OKRs die by week 3 of quarter
**Solution**: Assign explicit owner (PM, team lead, or rotating role) to prompt/facilitate rituals

## AI Integration Notes

### Context Signals for This SOP
Trigger this framework when users mention:
- "How often should we review OKRs?"
- "OKRs feel disconnected from daily work"
- "Team forgot about our goals"
- "What meetings/rituals do we need?"
- "How to keep OKRs alive all quarter?"

### Adaptation Guidance
- **Remote teams**: Async status updates (Slack/email) + sync Friday celebrations (video call)
- **Global teams**: Friday celebration might be Thursday for some timezones; choose what works
- **Very small teams (<10)**: Can combine Monday + Friday into single weekly check-in
- **Very large orgs (1000+)**: Status updates stay within business unit; leadership review at BU level only

### Critical Success Factors (Don't Compromise)
1. **Monday question**: "What am I doing THIS WEEK toward our goals?"
2. **Friday celebration**: Must happen; it's not optional
3. **Weekly visibility**: Status updates must be shared beyond immediate team
4. **Quarterly retrospective**: Learning matters more than grading precision
5. **Temporal landmarks**: Use Monday/Friday/Quarter-end (leverage existing human patterns)

### Edge Cases
- **Crisis mode**: When fighting fires, still do Friday celebrations (maybe shorter); skip Monday commitments only temporarily
- **Mid-quarter pivot**: If strategy changes, okay to reset OKRs; explain why in retrospective
- **New team members**: Give them 2-week grace period to learn; then full participation
- **Personal OKRs**: Same cadence works; accountability group replaces team sharing

### Integration with Other Systems
- **Agile/Scrum**: Weekly OKR status can incorporate sprint retrospective insights
- **Project management tools**: Link P1 initiatives to tickets/projects but don't over-integrate (keep OKRs simple)
- **Company all-hands**: Surface top OKR insights monthly or quarterly, not weekly (too detailed)
