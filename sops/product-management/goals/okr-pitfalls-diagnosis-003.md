## Metadata
- **Source**: Christina Wodtke - Lenny's Podcast
- **Domain**: Product Management - Goals
- **Type**: Framework + Checklist
- **Applicable To**: Leaders, Executives, Product Leaders, Team Leads implementing OKRs
- **Company Size**: All sizes (particularly relevant for 50-500 employees)
- **Difficulty**: Intermediate to Advanced

## Overview
A diagnostic framework for identifying why OKRs aren't working in your organization, with root cause analysis and corrective actions. OKRs are a "vitamin not medicine"—they reveal organizational problems rather than fixing them. This SOP helps you identify what's actually broken and how to fix it.

## When to Use
- When team is frustrated with OKRs or wants to abandon them
- When OKR meetings are boring and feel like waste of time
- When OKRs exist on paper but don't drive behavior
- When considering rolling out OKRs and want to avoid common mistakes
- When OKRs worked initially but have degraded over time

## Prerequisites
- Honest assessment capability (psychological safety to name issues)
- Willingness to address root causes (not just symptoms)
- Authority to make changes to process and potentially org structure
- Understanding of what good OKRs should look like (see okr-setting-framework-001.md)

## Diagnostic Framework

### Surface Symptom Analysis

First, identify the visible symptoms. Then use "5 Whys" to find root causes.

## Common Failure Patterns and Root Causes

### Pattern 1: OKRs Are Task Lists in Disguise

#### Symptoms:
- Key results are binary (done/not done) rather than measurable outcomes
- "Key results" sound like: "Launch feature X," "Complete project Y," "Ship Z"
- Progress tracking is just checking boxes
- No connection between completing tasks and business outcomes

#### Root Cause Analysis (5 Whys):
1. **Why are key results tasks?** → Team doesn't understand difference between outputs and outcomes
2. **Why doesn't team understand?** → No training/guidance on outcome-focused thinking
3. **Why no guidance?** → Leadership rushed implementation without learning
4. **Why rush?** → Read "Measure What Matters," got excited, rolled out company-wide immediately
5. **Root cause**: Illusion of knowledge—"I read the book, I understand" but didn't actually practice

#### Corrective Actions:
- **Immediate**: Rewrite current quarter OKRs with outcomes
  - For each "task" key result, ask: "Why are we doing this? What outcome does it create?"
  - Measure the outcome, not task completion
- **Exception**: Some binary milestones (e.g., "Pass product review") are okay if they represent genuinely hard-to-achieve outcomes
- **Long-term**: Pilot with best team first; let them learn and teach others

### Pattern 2: Meetings Are Boring and Feel Like Waste

#### Symptoms:
- Leadership reviews turn into 30+ minute slogs through spreadsheets
- Reviewing hundreds of IC-level tasks
- People zone out or multitask during OKR reviews
- No strategic conversations happening
- Everyone dreads the OKR meeting

#### Root Cause Analysis (5 Whys):
1. **Why boring?** → Meeting is too detailed (in the weeds)
2. **Why too detailed?** → Reviewing IC tasks instead of strategic progress
3. **Why reviewing tasks?** → Leader doesn't trust team to execute
4. **Why no trust?** → Either leader's management style OR wrong people hired
5. **Root causes**: Trust deficit + wrong altitude for leadership

#### Corrective Actions:
- **Immediate fix**: Change meeting format
  - Ask each team: "What are your top 2-3 initiatives? Why? Confidence level?"
  - Limit discussion: "I've seen that for 3 weeks. Are you trying something else soon?"
  - Trust teams to handle execution details
  - Duration should be ~10 minutes, not 30+
- **If trust is the issue**:
  - Ask: "Am I the asshole?" (If everyone seems incompetent, maybe you're the problem)
  - Are you being clear about strategy? Or are people genuinely unable to execute?
  - Consider: Do you need better hiring process? Or do you need to let go more?
- **Scaling issue**: OKRs enable leaders to scale by setting direction without controlling every task

### Pattern 3: Too Many OKRs (Peanut Butter Problem)

#### Symptoms:
- Team has 10, 15, 20+ OKRs per quarter
- Everything is equally "important"
- Progress is 1% here, 1% there, nothing moves substantially
- Teams feel scattered and unfocused
- Nothing gets to "done"

#### Root Cause Analysis:
1. **Why so many OKRs?** → Trying to do everything at once
2. **Why everything at once?** → Fear of saying no; fear of missing opportunities
3. **Why fear?** → No clear strategy or understanding of opportunity cost
4. **Root cause**: Lack of strategic clarity and prioritization discipline

**Historical reference**: Yahoo's "peanut butter memo"—spreading resources too thin

#### Corrective Actions:
- **Immediate**: Radical focus
  - Reduce to ONE company/team OKR per quarter
  - Other work becomes P2/P3 (keep things running, but not the priority)
  - Move non-critical initiatives to future quarters
- **Strategic**: Adopt quarter-by-quarter approach
  - Q1: Move the retention rock
  - Q2: Move the acquisition rock
  - Q3: Move the monetization rock
  - You don't forget Q1 learnings; you build on them
- **Mental model**: Big rocks can only be moved one at a time; attempting to move all at once moves none

### Pattern 4: OKRs Disconnected from Daily Work

#### Symptoms:
- OKRs written at start of quarter, never referenced again
- Team can't recall their OKRs mid-quarter
- Weekly work doesn't connect to key results
- OKRs feel like "extra" work, not the work

#### Root Cause Analysis:
1. **Why disconnected?** → No weekly check-in ritual
2. **Why no ritual?** → Didn't establish cadence
3. **Why no cadence?** → Treated OKR-setting as one-time event, not ongoing system
4. **Root cause**: Missing the atomic unit: "What am I doing THIS WEEK toward goals?"

#### Corrective Actions:
- **Immediate**: Implement Monday commitments
  - Every Monday: Review OKRs and answer "What am I doing this week to move forward?"
  - Share status (email/Slack) with confidence levels and P1s
- **Add**: Friday celebrations to bookend the week
- **Critical**: Make the question "What am I doing this week?" the centerpiece
- **Use temporal landmarks**: Leverage Monday's natural "fresh start" feeling

### Pattern 5: Rolled Out Too Fast, Company-Wide

#### Symptoms:
- Initial excitement, then rapid disillusionment
- Different teams interpreting OKRs completely differently
- No shared language or understanding
- Can't get aligned on what "good" looks like
- People want to abandon OKRs within 1-2 quarters

#### Root Cause:
- Speed over learning
- Didn't pilot or let anyone experiment
- "We read the book, we got this" → illusion of knowledge
- Asked HR to implement (removed from actual product work)

#### Corrective Actions:
- **If already rolled out badly**:
  - Pause. Admit "We moved too fast."
  - Reset with best 1-2 teams as pilot
  - Give them 3 months to figure out what works
  - Gradually expand: 2 more teams, then 2 more
- **If planning rollout**:
  - Give book to best multidisciplinary team
  - "We're considering OKRs. Can you try this and tell us what you learn?"
  - Best teams want to improve; they'll adapt OKRs to your culture
  - They'll identify where OKRs don't fit your context
  - Use their learnings as template for broader rollout
- **Timeline**: 3-month pilot, then expand every quarter

### Pattern 6: Missing Prerequisites (The "Medicine" Problem)

#### Symptoms:
- OKRs reveal chaos rather than create focus
- Teams don't know how to set strategy-aligned goals
- Constant firefighting, no strategic work happens
- Teams wait for leadership to tell them what to do
- No innovation or autonomous decision-making

#### Root Cause Analysis:
**OKRs are a vitamin, not medicine.** They supercharge what's already working; they don't fix what's broken.

**Missing prerequisites:**
1. **No strategy**: Company doesn't have clear hypothesis about how to win
   - Symptom: Leaders say "We want growth" but don't say HOW
   - Can't set OKRs without strategic direction
2. **No empowerment**: Teams aren't trusted to make decisions
   - Symptom: Everything requires approval; no autonomy
   - OKRs become micromanagement tool
3. **No psychological safety**: Teams can't admit when things aren't working
   - Symptom: Everyone reports green status even when failing
   - OKRs become performative rather than honest

#### Corrective Actions:
- **Do the hard work first**:
  1. **Create strategy**: Develop clear hypothesis about how to win in market
     - What are you building? For whom? How will it grow?
     - What are your core beliefs about the business?
  2. **Empower teams**: Give teams objectives and let them determine how
     - Stop approving every decision
     - Create guidelines, not gatekeeping
  3. **Build psychological safety**: Make it safe to fail and learn
     - Leaders model vulnerability
     - Celebrate learning from failure
- **Only then**: Implement OKRs to maintain alignment and focus
- **Reality check**: If your company culture is broken, OKRs will just reveal it painfully

### Pattern 7: Approval Process Kills Momentum

#### Symptoms:
- Takes 2-3 weeks to get OKRs "approved"
- Multiple rounds of edits and wordsmithing
- Senior leaders become bottleneck
- Quarter starts late because OKRs aren't finalized
- Team frustration with bureaucracy

#### Root Cause:
- Top-down approval chains
- Perfectionism (wordsmithing forever)
- Leader reviewing too many team OKRs (doesn't scale)

#### Corrective Actions:
- **Replace approval with peer review**:
  - Each team identifies 3 peer teams who understand their work
  - Share OKRs for 24-hour feedback turnaround
  - Feedback: "Does this make sense? Is it achievable? Any concerns?"
  - That's it. Done.
- **Leader constraint**: If 10 teams ask you to review OKRs, say no to some
  - You can't be bottleneck
  - Delegate review to peer teams
- **Avoid perfection**: Don't spend hours wordsmithing
  - Better to ship and learn than perfect planning
  - "Good enough" beats "perfect"
- **Time limit**: OKR planning should take 4 days to 1 week maximum

### Pattern 8: Grading Becomes More Important Than Learning

#### Symptoms:
- Teams spend hours calculating precise grades (0.753 vs 0.7)
- Fighting about measurement methodology
- Trying to create "objective" systems for qualitative goals
- Retrospectives are rushed or skipped
- Focus on defending grades rather than learning

#### Root Cause:
- Tying OKRs to performance reviews or compensation
- Belief that precision equals rigor
- Missing the point: Learning matters more than grading

#### Corrective Actions:
- **Shift focus to retrospective**:
  - Grading is secondary
  - The valuable conversation: "Why 80%? What got in our way? What did we learn?"
  - Hand-wave estimates are fine
  - 10 minutes grading, 30 minutes retrospective
- **Decouple from performance reviews**:
  - OKRs are for learning, not individual assessment
  - Otherwise: Sandbagging, conservative goals, fear
- **Accept imprecision**: Some goals are qualitative; that's okay
  - Customer panels, qualitative research, judgment calls
  - Don't create fake precision

## The Diagnostic Checklist

Use this to identify what's broken:

### Foundation Check (Prerequisites)
- [ ] We have a clear strategy (hypothesis about how to win)
- [ ] Teams are empowered to make decisions
- [ ] Psychological safety exists (safe to admit failure)
- [ ] We hired competent people we trust
- [ ] Leadership has time/attention for this

**If any are "no"**: Fix these first before expecting OKRs to work

### Process Check
- [ ] OKRs use outcomes, not tasks, in key results
- [ ] We have ONE focused OKR per quarter (not 10+)
- [ ] Weekly ritual connects work to OKRs
- [ ] Friday celebrations happen consistently
- [ ] Grading includes retrospective/learning
- [ ] Approval process takes <1 week
- [ ] Meetings are 10 minutes and strategic, not boring

**If any are "no"**: These are process fixes (easier than foundation)

### Culture Check
- [ ] Teams can recall their OKRs mid-quarter
- [ ] OKRs drive decisions ("Does this help our OKR?")
- [ ] Meetings about OKRs are energizing, not draining
- [ ] People see value in the system
- [ ] Estimation is improving over time
- [ ] Teams adapt OKRs to their context (not rigid)

**If any are "no"**: Indicates OKRs aren't embedded in culture yet

## Expected Outcomes
- Clear diagnosis of what's actually broken (not just "OKRs don't work")
- Roadmap for fixing root causes, not symptoms
- Realistic assessment of whether organization is ready for OKRs
- Prevention of common pitfalls for new implementations
- Ability to revive failed OKR implementations
- Understanding that most failures are organizational, not OKR methodology itself

## Common Pitfalls

### Pitfall 1: Blaming the Tool
**Problem**: "OKRs don't work for us" when real issue is execution or prerequisites
**Solution**: Use this diagnostic to find real root cause

### Pitfall 2: Surface-Level Fixes
**Problem**: Changing OKR template format when real issue is lack of strategy
**Solution**: Do the 5 Whys to get to actual root cause

### Pitfall 3: Giving Up Too Soon
**Problem**: Abandoning after one bad quarter
**Solution**: Expect 2-3 quarters to get good at OKRs; it's a learned skill

### Pitfall 4: Treating All Problems as Equal
**Problem**: Foundation issues (no strategy) are different from process issues (bad meetings)
**Solution**: Fix foundation first, process second, culture emerges from those

## AI Integration Notes

### Context Signals for This SOP
Trigger this diagnostic when users mention:
- "OKRs aren't working for us"
- "Should we abandon OKRs?"
- "Our OKR process is broken"
- "Team hates OKRs"
- "Thinking about implementing OKRs"
- "OKR meetings are boring"

### Diagnostic Process for AI
1. Ask clarifying questions about symptoms
2. Apply relevant pattern analysis from this SOP
3. Use 5 Whys to identify root cause
4. Check prerequisites first (foundation issues)
5. Then check process issues
6. Provide specific corrective actions, not generic advice

### Key Principles to Preserve
1. **OKRs are a vitamin, not medicine**: They reveal problems, don't fix broken orgs
2. **Most failures are organizational**: Not methodology issues
3. **Pilot first**: Best teams figure out what works in your culture
4. **Foundation before process**: Strategy, empowerment, safety must exist first
5. **Speed kills**: Rushing rollout is #1 cause of failure

### Edge Cases
- **Startups (<20 people)**: Foundation issues are more common; might not need formal OKRs yet
- **Enterprise (1000+)**: Approval processes and alignment are bigger challenges
- **Turnaround situations**: OKRs might not be right tool when in crisis mode; survive first
- **Highly hierarchical orgs**: Empowerment prerequisite is hardest; requires culture change
