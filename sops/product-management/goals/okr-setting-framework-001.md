## Overview
A practical framework for setting effective OKRs (Objectives and Key Results) that drive focus, alignment, and measurable progress. This approach emphasizes simplicity, asking the right questions, and connecting quarterly goals to broader strategy and mission.

## When to Use
- When planning quarterly goals and priorities
- When you need to align team efforts around strategic outcomes
- When existing goals feel too vague or task-oriented
- When translating annual strategy into actionable quarterly plans
- When teams struggle with focus and have too many priorities

## Prerequisites
- Clear mission or vision for your company/team (5-year horizon)
- Defined strategy (annual plan with key hypotheses)
- Psychological safety and empowered teams
- Understanding of current company/team metrics and baselines

## Procedure

### Step 1: Start with Mission and Strategy
**Connect to the "Why"**
- Review your 5-year mission: What change do you want to create?
- Don't make mission overly vague to last forever; a 5-year mission is acceptable
- Example: "Bring amazing games that delight our users and we're proud to ship into the world"
- Articulate your annual strategy: What's your strongly held hypothesis about how to win in the market?
- Strategy should answer: Are you shipping physical or digital products? Subscription or one-off sales? What platform choices?

**Avoid**: Skipping directly to tactics without connecting to mission/strategy

### Step 2: Create Half-Built Strategy for the Year
**Map out quarterly themes without full detail**
- Identify 4 quarterly focus areas that ladder up to annual strategy
- Example for new game launch:
  - Q1: Figure out what the game is and validate user interest
  - Q2: Get early prototypes out and validate concepts
  - Q3: Build extensively
  - Q4: Market and launch
- Keep this at the objective level; don't write key results for future quarters yet

**Why**: Too much planning locks you in; too little makes you reactive to everything

### Step 3: Craft the Quarterly Objective
**Create an inspiring, motivating vision for the quarter**
- Write as a proper goal, not a task or feature
- Make it motivating enough that when your alarm goes off, you think "I'm changing the world today"
- Avoid being too fluffy ("delight customers") or too boring ("ship feature X")
- Root it in the quarterly theme from your half-built strategy
- Example: "Have a validated game concept that excites users and is technically feasible"

**Quality check**: Would this objective make someone excited to work on Monday morning?

### Step 4: Answer "How Would We Know?" for Key Results
**Use this exact question to generate key results**
- After writing objective, ask: "How would we know we succeeded?"
- Spend 10 minutes brainstorming every possible way to measure success
  - First 3-4 minutes: Obvious metrics emerge
  - Middle minutes: Feel stuck, no ideas
  - Final minutes: Weird, creative ideas appear (often the best insights)
- Aim for three key results that triangulate success

**The Rule of Three for Key Results:**
1. **One hardcore number**: Clear quantitative metric (DAU, conversion rate, revenue)
2. **One quality measure**: Ensure you don't forget what matters (NPS, panel feedback, qualitative research)
3. **One dollar sign**: Business outcome or monetization metric

**Example for validated game concept objective:**
- 30% of audience creates profiles and engages with concept
- Weekly active users like/bookmark 3+ elements per week
- Bi-weekly customer panels rate excitement at 8/10+

### Step 5: Set Ambitious but Not Doomed Targets
**Calibrate for stretch goals**
- Target should feel "somewhat uncomfortable but not doomed"
- Aim for 70-80% as a reasonable success threshold
- Purpose: You'll never know what you're capable of unless you try something you're unsure you can do
- Literature supports: Ambitious goals are motivating unless they feel impossible
- Accept that you'll be bad at estimating initially; estimation is a learned skill that improves with practice

**Avoid**: Setting conservative goals that don't push the team OR setting impossible goals that demoralize

### Step 6: Keep It Simple
**Template is exactly this simple:**
```
Objective: [Inspiring quarterly goal]

Key Results:
1. [Quantitative metric with target]
2. [Quality/engagement metric with target]
3. [Business/revenue metric with target]
```

**No more complexity needed**
- Simple things give you room to adapt
- Complex methodologies make people focus on rules instead of results
- One objective per quarter (radical focus)
- Three key results to triangulate

### Step 7: Plan Only Current Quarter in Detail
**Avoid over-planning future quarters**
- Write objectives for Q2-Q4 but NOT key results
- Key results cause arguments, take time to track down, and may not be relevant
- Wait to see how current quarter goes before detailing next quarter
- This creates strategic flexibility while maintaining direction

**Time investment**: Should take no more than one week total, ideally 4 days

### Step 8: Get Fast Peer Feedback (Not Top-Down Approval)
**Use lateral approval process**
- Identify 3 teams/people who work with you enough to know your context
- Share OKRs and ask for 24-hour turnaround feedback
- They review for: Does this make sense? Is this achievable? Any concerns?
- That's it—no lengthy approval chain
- If your manager needs to review 10+ team OKRs, they should say no to some requests

**Why this works**: Fast, practical, avoids approval bottlenecks that kill momentum

## Expected Outcomes
- One clear, motivating objective per quarter
- Three measurable key results that triangulate success
- Team alignment on the single most important thing
- Reduced context-switching and dilution of effort
- Faster decision-making (everyone knows what matters)
- Improved estimation skills over time
- Learning cycles that compound quarterly

## Common Pitfalls

### Pitfall 1: Making Objectives Too Fluffy
**Problem**: Objectives like "Improve customer satisfaction" don't inspire anyone
**Solution**: Add specificity and meaning—what does satisfaction enable? Why does it matter now?

### Pitfall 2: Putting Tasks in Key Results
**Problem**: "Launch new feature" is a task, not an outcome
**Solution**: Ask "Why are we launching this? What outcome does it create?" Measure that outcome
**Exception**: Binary milestones like "Pass product review" can work if they represent hard-to-achieve outcomes

### Pitfall 3: Too Many OKRs
**Problem**: 20 OKRs per quarter = no focus = peanut butter spread thin
**Solution**: One OKR per quarter (radical focus); everything else is P2/P3 work

### Pitfall 4: Not Having Prerequisites (Strategy, Empowerment, Safety)
**Problem**: Using OKRs to "fix" broken company culture or lack of strategy
**Solution**: OKRs are a vitamin, not medicine—get your foundation right first
- Need: Clear strategy
- Need: Empowered teams
- Need: Psychological safety
**Reality check**: OKRs will reveal what's broken; fix those things first

### Pitfall 5: Rolling Out Too Fast Without Learning
**Problem**: Reading "Measure What Matters," getting excited, implementing company-wide immediately
**Solution**:
- Give book to your best multidisciplinary team
- Let them pilot for 3 months
- Learn what works in your culture
- Gradually expand to 2 more teams, then 2 more
- Best teams want to improve and will adapt OKRs to your context

### Pitfall 6: Wordsmithing Forever
**Problem**: Spending hours perfecting objective wording
**Solution**: Don't get caught up in making it perfect; good enough is good enough
**Better use of time**: Ship, learn, iterate next quarter

### Pitfall 7: Not Connecting Weekly Work to OKRs
**Problem**: OKRs exist in document, but daily work is disconnected
**Solution**: Every Monday ask: "What am I doing this week to get closer to our OKRs?"
**This is the atomic unit**: Weekly connection between strategy and execution

### Pitfall 8: Trying to Measure Everything Precisely
**Problem**: Spending enormous time on fake measurement systems for qualitative goals
**Solution**: Hand-wave estimates are fine (70%, 80%); focus on learning, not precision
**Reality**: Grading precision matters less than the retrospective conversation

## AI Integration Notes

### Context Signals for This SOP
Trigger this framework when users mention:
- "Setting quarterly goals"
- "How do we write OKRs?"
- "Our goals are too vague/too many"
- "Need to align team around priorities"
- "Planning Q1/Q2/Q3/Q4"

### Adaptation Guidance
- **For startups (<50 people)**: Emphasize speed and learning; start with just leadership team or one product team
- **For scale-ups (200+)**: Focus on peer review process and preventing approval bottlenecks
- **For teams without strategy**: Flag this as a prerequisite—help them create strategy first
- **For teams with many OKRs**: Emphasize radical focus and reducing to ONE per quarter

### Key Principles to Preserve
1. The core question: "What am I doing this week to move toward our goals?"
2. Simplicity over complexity in format
3. Connection between mission → strategy → OKRs → weekly work
4. Ambitious but not doomed calibration
5. Learning through iteration, not perfect planning

### Edge Cases
- **Highly regulated industries**: May need more planning/approval; adapt timeline but keep simplicity
- **Platform/infrastructure teams**: Key results might be enablement metrics (adoption by product teams) rather than user metrics
- **Multiple business units**: Each unit should have its own OKR; company level has one unifying OKR
- **Personal OKRs**: Same framework works; mission = life goals, strategy = yearly theme
