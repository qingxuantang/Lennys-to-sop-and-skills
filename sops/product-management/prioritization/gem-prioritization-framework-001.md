# GEM Prioritization Framework (Growth, Engagement, Monetization)

## Metadata
- **Source**: Gibson Biddle - Lenny's Podcast
- **Domain**: Product Management / Prioritization
- **Type**: Framework SOP
- **Applicable To**: Product Managers, Product Leaders, Founders, CEOs
- **Company Stage**: Startups through Scale-ups
- **Difficulty**: Beginner

## Overview
The GEM Framework (also called JAM - Juice, Attention, Money) provides a simple forcing function to align leadership on the company's top priorities. By stack-ranking Growth, Engagement, and Monetization, teams can resolve fundamental strategic disagreements and create clear prioritization criteria. The key insight: **this is the #1 source of misalignment at startups** and explicitly ranking these three creates alignment.

## When to Use
- Leadership disagrees on priorities
- CEO and CFO have conflicting views
- Teams are pulling in different directions
- Starting a new role (VP/CPO)
- Annual or quarterly planning
- Evaluating any major initiative
- Unclear what to build next

## Prerequisites
- Access to leadership team
- Willingness to make hard tradeoffs
- Metrics to measure each dimension

## Core Concept: Force Rank Three Things

### G - Growth
**Definition**: Year-over-year customer or user growth.

**Questions:**
- How fast do we need to acquire new customers?
- What's our target growth rate (10%? 50%? 100%)?
- Is this the most important thing right now?

**When Growth comes first:**
- Pre-product-market fit (find more users to validate)
- Network effect businesses (need critical mass)
- Winner-take-all markets (land grab)
- After raising funding (deploy capital)

**Metrics:**
- New user/customer growth rate
- Total addressable market penetration
- Customer acquisition cost (CAC)

### E - Engagement
**Definition**: Product quality and customer satisfaction.

**Questions:**
- Is our product good enough?
- Are users getting value?
- Will they stick around?

**When Engagement comes first:**
- High churn threatening growth
- Core product is broken
- Competitors have better product
- Retention is the primary metric

**Metrics:**
- Retention rate (monthly, weekly)
- NPS score
- Usage frequency
- Feature adoption

**Key insight**: Engagement is how you measure product quality.

### M - Monetization
**Definition**: Revenue and profitability.

**Questions:**
- Do we have a working business model?
- Can we sustain the business?
- Are we capturing the value we create?

**When Monetization comes first:**
- Burn rate threatening survival
- Unclear if business model works
- High growth but no path to profit
- Preparing for profitability milestone

**Metrics:**
- Revenue per user
- Gross margin
- Customer lifetime value (LTV)
- LTV:CAC ratio

## Procedure

### Step 1: Develop Your Own SWAG
Before discussing with others, form your own hypothesis.

**SWAG = Stupid Wild-Ass Guess**
- Don't overthink it
- Write down your initial ranking: G > E > M, or M > E > G, etc.
- Note your reasoning for each choice

**Gibson's approach:**
> "I would give myself two weeks to develop the product strategy for a new company, which is a little outrageous, but I would just do it fast."

### Step 2: Gather Input One-on-One
Share your SWAG with key stakeholders individually.

**How to gather input:**
- Share your thinking: "Here's my best guess..."
- Ask for their perspective: "What do you think?"
- Listen for disagreements
- Refine your thinking

**Stakeholders to consult:**
- CEO
- CFO
- CTO
- Head of Sales
- Head of Marketing
- Board members (if appropriate)

### Step 3: Identify Fundamental Disagreements
Look for the CEO vs CFO pattern.

**Gibson's Chegg example:**
- CEO Dan: "Grow, baby, grow!"
- CFO Greg: "Slow down, we don't know if the model works"
- Both were smart, both had good reasons
- Fundamental misalignment was crippling the company

**Common disagreements:**
| Role | Typical Priority | Reasoning |
|------|-----------------|-----------|
| CEO | Growth | "We need to capture market" |
| CFO | Monetization | "We need sustainable unit economics" |
| CPO | Engagement | "We need a better product" |
| Sales | Growth | "We need more leads" |
| Customer Success | Engagement | "We're churning too much" |

### Step 4: Force the Ranking Decision
Get leadership in a room and make them agree.

**Facilitation approach:**
1. Present the framework
2. Ask each person to rank G, E, M
3. Surface disagreements
4. Discuss tradeoffs
5. Force a decision
6. Document and communicate

**If they can't agree:**
- Make the disagreement explicit
- Escalate to CEO for final call
- If CEO and CFO fundamentally disagree, it may need board resolution

**Gibson's approach at Chegg:**
> "I got them in a room and said, 'Listen, I just need you to force rank these three factors for me: growth, engagement, and monetization. And I need the two of you to agree.'"

### Step 5: Align on Metrics for Each
Define how you'll measure success in each dimension.

**Engagement metric is hardest:**
- Netflix: Monthly retention rate
- B2B SaaS: Weekly active users, feature adoption
- Marketplace: Repeat transaction rate
- Social: Daily active users / monthly active users

**Example metrics stack:**
| Priority | Dimension | Metric | Target |
|----------|-----------|--------|--------|
| 1 | Growth | YoY customer growth | 50% |
| 2 | Engagement | Monthly retention | 96% |
| 3 | Monetization | Revenue per user | $15/mo |

### Step 6: Apply to Prioritization
Use the ranking to make decisions.

**Example application:**
- Three projects competing for resources:
  - Project A: Would increase growth 20%
  - Project B: Would improve retention 5%
  - Project C: Would increase ARPU 10%
- If Growth > Engagement > Monetization, prioritize A > B > C

### Step 7: Revisit Regularly
The ranking should change over time.

**Common transitions:**
- **Early stage**: G > E > M (find product-market fit)
- **Growth stage**: E > G > M (product quality drives growth)
- **Maturity**: M > E > G (optimize profitability)

**Review cadence:**
- Quarterly at minimum
- After major market changes
- When leadership changes

## Expected Outcomes
- Clear prioritization criteria
- Aligned leadership team
- Faster decision-making
- Reduced organizational friction
- Better resource allocation

## Common Pitfalls

### Not forcing the decision
- Leaders will try to say "all three are important"
- Force the ranking anyway
- The point is to clarify tradeoffs

### Ignoring fundamental disagreements
- At Chegg, the disagreement led to CFO leaving
- Better to surface early than let it fester
- "These are the kinds of fundamental misalignments that can wreck startups"

### Keeping the ranking static
- Early stage is different from growth stage
- Market changes require re-evaluation
- Don't set it and forget it

### Making it too complex
- Keep it simple: three things, ranked 1-2-3
- Don't add dimensions
- Don't weight them (just rank)

## AI Integration Notes

### Context signals that should trigger this SOP:
- User mentions conflicting priorities
- Leadership misalignment
- "Should we focus on growth or retention?"
- Resource allocation debates

### How to apply:
- Start with SWAG approach
- Surface disagreements explicitly
- Force a simple 1-2-3 ranking
- Connect ranking to specific metrics

### Key insight:
The framework's power is in its simplicity. Resist the urge to complicate it. The goal is alignment, not precision.
