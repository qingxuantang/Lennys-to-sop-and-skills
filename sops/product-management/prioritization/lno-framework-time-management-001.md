# LNO Framework for PM Time Management

## Metadata
- **Source**: Shreyas Doshi - Lenny's Podcast
- **Domain**: Product Management / Personal Productivity
- **Type**: Framework SOP
- **Applicable To**: Product Managers, Product Leaders, anyone in high-leverage roles
- **Difficulty**: Beginner to Intermediate

## Overview
The LNO Framework categorizes all tasks into three types based on the return on effort: Leverage (L), Neutral (N), and Overhead (O). The key insight is that ambitious professionals often treat all tasks with the same level of effort, which is a critical mistake. Different task types deserve different levels of investment.

## When to Use
- Feeling overwhelmed with too much to do
- Working long hours but not making impact
- Struggling to find time for strategic work
- To-do list never gets shorter
- Need to make better decisions about where to invest energy

## Prerequisites
- List of current tasks/responsibilities
- Honest assessment of task types
- Willingness to do some tasks "good enough" instead of perfect

## Core Concept: Three Types of Tasks

### L - Leverage Tasks
**Definition**: Tasks where you put in 1X effort and get 10X or 100X in return.

**Characteristics:**
- High impact on outcomes
- Often strategic or foundational
- Usually the hardest, most uncertain work
- Often what you procrastinate on
- Deep work requiring focus

**Examples for PMs:**
- Writing the PRD for a major feature
- Developing product strategy
- Aligning two misaligned teams
- Building relationships with key stakeholders
- Making critical architectural decisions

### N - Neutral Tasks
**Definition**: Tasks where you put in 1X effort and get 1X or 1.1X in return.

**Characteristics:**
- Necessary but not differentiating
- Need to be done, but perfectionism doesn't pay off
- Often recurring operational work
- "Good enough" is the right quality bar

**Examples for PMs:**
- Routine status updates
- Standard bug reports
- Regular meeting notes
- Basic documentation
- Responding to standard requests

### O - Overhead Tasks
**Definition**: Tasks where you put in 1X effort but get less than 1X in return.

**Characteristics:**
- Administrative necessity
- No direct value creation
- Can't be eliminated but should be minimized
- Often required by organizational process

**Examples for PMs:**
- Expense reports
- Time tracking
- Certain compliance tasks
- Administrative paperwork
- Some mandatory meetings

## Procedure

### Step 1: Audit Your Current Tasks

List everything you're spending time on this week:
- Regular meetings
- Projects and initiatives
- Recurring tasks
- Ad hoc requests
- Administrative work

### Step 2: Classify Each Task

For each task, ask: **What's the return on additional effort?**

| Task | More Effort = More Return? | Classification |
|------|---------------------------|----------------|
| Strategy doc | Yes, significantly | L |
| Weekly update | Not really | N |
| Expense report | Definitely not | O |

**Key insight**: The SAME activity can be L, N, or O depending on context.

**Filing a bug report:**
- Critical production issue affecting revenue → L task (be detailed)
- Minor UI inconsistency → N task (be efficient)
- Known issue being tracked elsewhere → O task (quick reference)

**Writing meeting notes:**
- Strategic decision with CEO → L task (perfect them)
- Team sync → N task (action items only)
- FYI meeting → O task (minimal or skip)

### Step 3: Match Effort to Task Type

**For L tasks:**
- Schedule during peak energy hours
- Block uninterrupted time
- Let your inner perfectionist shine
- Invest heavily in quality
- This is where impact comes from

**For N tasks:**
- Do efficiently, not perfectly
- Set time limits
- Use templates and shortcuts
- "Good enough" is the goal
- Don't over-invest

**For O tasks:**
- Minimize time spent
- Automate where possible
- Do the bare minimum acceptable
- Batch together
- Consider delegation

### Step 4: Create Time for L Tasks

**Problem**: L tasks are often procrastinated because they're hard and uncertain.

**Tactics to tackle L tasks:**

**1. Placebo Productivity**
Before tackling a big L task:
- Spend 1-2 days doing N and O tasks
- Remind yourself: "I'm doing placebo productivity"
- This tricks your brain into being ready for deep work
- Then tackle the L task

**2. Change of Location**
On the appointed day for an L task:
- Work from a different location
- Coffee shop, co-working space, library
- Change of environment forces focus
- Breaks routine that enables procrastination

**3. Time Blocking**
- Block dedicated time for L tasks
- Morning often best (peak energy)
- No meetings during L task blocks
- Defend this time aggressively

### Step 5: Recognize L Task Avoidance

**Signs you're avoiding L tasks:**
- Endless time on N and O tasks
- "I'll get to strategy next week"
- Feeling busy but not impactful
- Avoiding uncertain/ambiguous work
- Seeking quick wins over hard wins

**Deep reason for avoidance:**
You know L tasks are important, which creates fear of not being good enough. Time becomes a convenient excuse: "I don't have time" really means "I'm afraid I won't do this well."

**The cave you fear contains the treasure you seek.**

### Step 6: Rebalance Your Week

**Ideal distribution** (varies by role):
- L tasks: 30-40% of time
- N tasks: 40-50% of time
- O tasks: 10-20% of time

**Reality for most people:**
- L tasks: 10-20% of time
- N tasks: 50-60% of time
- O tasks: 20-30% of time

**Goal**: Shift time from N and O to L.

## Expected Outcomes
- Higher impact with same hours worked
- Less stress and overwhelm
- Better strategic work
- Appropriate quality for each task type
- More sustainable work patterns

## Common Pitfalls

### Treating all tasks the same
- Perfectionism on O tasks wastes time
- Under-investment in L tasks limits impact
- Match effort to return

### Confusing busy with productive
- Doing N and O tasks feels productive
- But L tasks create real value
- Track where your impact comes from

### Not recognizing L task avoidance
- Easy to stay busy on N tasks
- Hard work feels like productivity
- But strategic work creates leverage

### Over-categorizing everything as L
- Not everything is high leverage
- Be honest about what truly matters
- Most tasks are N tasks

- Three Levels of Product Work
- Pre-Mortem Technique
- Strategic Time Management

## AI Integration Notes

### Context signals that should trigger this SOP:
- User mentions being "too busy"
- Questions about prioritization
- Feeling overwhelmed with tasks
- Can't find time for strategic work

### How to apply:
- First step: Help classify current tasks
- Identify which L tasks are being avoided
- Suggest tactics for tackling L tasks
- Look for N/O tasks consuming too much energy

### Key insight:
The highest-leverage tasks are often the ones you're avoiding. Fear of uncertainty makes you default to "safer" N and O tasks.
