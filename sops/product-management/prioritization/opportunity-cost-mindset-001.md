- **Difficulty**: Intermediate

## Overview
In high leverage roles, you should stop doing work that simply provides positive ROI and start focusing on work that minimizes opportunity cost. The key insight: **in high leverage roles, hundreds of things provide positive ROI, but the best option is the one that minimizes what you're giving up**.

## When to Use
- Quarterly/annual planning
- Prioritizing roadmap items
- Evaluating "quick wins"
- Personal time allocation
- Resource allocation decisions
- Avoiding the quick-win trap

## Prerequisites
- Understanding of leverage in your role
- Access to potential high-impact opportunities
- Willingness to resist easy wins
- Time allocation data

## Core Concept: ROI vs Opportunity Cost

### The ROI Mindset (Suboptimal)
**Formula:** ROI = (Value Created - Cost) / Cost

**Problem:** When cost (time) is in the denominator, we minimize time to maximize ROI.

**Result:** We gravitate toward:
- Quick wins
- Low-hanging fruit
- Safe bets
- Things that take less time

### The Opportunity Cost Mindset (Optimal)
**Formula:** Opportunity Cost = Value of Best Option - Value of Chosen Option

**Goal:** Minimize opportunity cost by choosing the best option.

**Result:** We focus on:
- Highest potential impact
- Bigger bets with bigger upside
- Work that only you can do
- Strategic initiatives

### Why This Matters in High Leverage Roles
In high leverage roles (PM, engineering lead, founder):
- Hundreds of things provide positive ROI
- Most of those things are the wrong things to work on
- The cost of missing the best opportunity is massive
- Quick wins can fill your plate while big opportunities pass

## Procedure

### Step 1: Recognize the Quick-Win Trap
Identify when you're chasing positive ROI over best outcomes.

**Signs of the quick-win trap:**
- Roadmap is full of small improvements
- No scary projects on the list
- Everyone agrees on priorities (too easily)
- "We'll get to the big thing next quarter"
- Lots of shipped items, little trajectory change

**Questions to ask:**
- Are we working on the things that could change our trajectory?
- Would our competitors be worried about our roadmap?
- Are we avoiding the hard things?

### Step 2: List Your Potential Options
Before prioritizing, expand the option set.

**Include:**
- Quick wins and safe bets (the usual suspects)
- Big scary projects (often excluded)
- Strategic initiatives (often "next quarter")
- Research/exploration (often deprioritized)

**Force inclusion of at least:**
- One option that could 10X outcomes
- One option that requires exploration first
- One option that others have said "not yet" to

### Step 3: Evaluate Each Option's Potential
Assess maximum upside, not just expected value.

**For each option, ask:**
- What's the best case outcome?
- How much could this change our trajectory?
- Is this a one-time opportunity?
- What happens if we never do this?

**Quick win example:**
- Best case: 5% improvement in metric
- Trajectory change: None
- One-time: No, always available
- If never done: Minor loss

**Big bet example:**
- Best case: Opens new market segment
- Trajectory change: Significant
- One-time: Yes, competitor could do it first
- If never done: Major opportunity loss

### Step 4: Compare Opportunity Costs
Ask "What am I giving up?" not "Is this valuable?"

**Instead of asking:**
- "Will this work provide value?" (ROI question)

**Ask:**
- "Is this the best use of my time?" (Opportunity cost question)

**Comparison framework:**
| Option | Upside Potential | Opportunity if Delayed | Best Option Rank |
|--------|-----------------|----------------------|------------------|
| Quick win A | Low | Low | 4 |
| Quick win B | Low | Low | 5 |
| Big bet X | High | High | 1 |
| Strategic Y | High | Medium | 2 |
| Research Z | Unknown-High | Medium | 3 |

### Step 5: Allocate by Category
Use percentage allocation to force big bets.

**Shreyas's example allocation:**
| Category | Allocation | Description |
|----------|------------|-------------|
| Incrementals | 60% | High-ROI improvements to existing product |
| Big New Initiatives | 30% | Trajectory-changing work (1-2 max) |
| Stability/Infrastructure | 10% | Technical investments |

**How allocation helps:**
- Forces room for big bets (they can't be crowded out)
- Limits incrementals (can't fill the whole roadmap)
- Makes tradeoffs explicit

**Setting your allocation:**
- Early stage: More exploration, less incrementals
- Growth stage: Balanced
- Mature: More incrementals and stability

### Step 6: Resist the Fill-Up
Protect the big bet allocation.

**Common failure mode:**
1. Allocate 30% to big bets
2. Struggle to define big bet clearly
3. Fill remaining capacity with quick wins
4. "We'll figure out the big bet next quarter"
5. Repeat forever

**Protection strategies:**
- Start planning with big bets, not incrementals
- Keep big bet slots even if not fully defined
- Make big bet progress visible
- Leadership should ask about big bets first

### Step 7: Track What You're Giving Up
Make opportunity cost visible.

**Quarterly retrospective questions:**
- What big opportunities did we not pursue?
- Are we happy with that tradeoff?
- Did we fill our time with incrementals?
- What would we do differently?

## Expected Outcomes
- More trajectory-changing work gets done
- Less "busy but not strategic" work
- Better risk-taking in portfolio
- Clearer prioritization decisions
- Competitive advantages built

## Common Pitfalls

### The "we'll get to it next quarter" trap
- Big bets keep getting postponed
- Incrementals always seem more urgent
- Next quarter never comes
- Require commitment now, not promises later

### Confusing busyness with progress
- Quick wins feel productive
- Lots of shipped items
- But trajectory doesn't change
- Activity is not achievement

### Letting incrementals crowd out bets
- Easy to define, easy to estimate
- Safe, low-controversy
- But limited upside
- Protect the big bet allocation

### Not including big bets in the option set
- If they're not on the list, they can't be chosen
- Force inclusion of scary options
- Challenge "not yet" assumptions

### Quantifying opportunity cost
- Opportunity cost is a mindset, not a metric
- Don't try to put numbers on it
- Use it for framing, not calculation

## AI Integration Notes

### Context signals that should trigger this SOP:
- User prioritizing many small items
- "We have lots of quick wins"
- "We'll do the big thing later"
- Roadmap full of incrementals

### How to apply:
- Challenge ROI-only thinking
- Ask what's being given up
- Push for big bet inclusion
- Suggest allocation percentages

### Key insight:
Don't ask "Will this provide value?" (almost everything will). Ask "Is this the best use of our limited time?" That's the difference between positive ROI thinking and opportunity cost thinking.
