# Pre-Mortem Technique for Project Risk Identification

## Metadata
- **Source**: Shreyas Doshi - Lenny's Podcast
- **Domain**: Product Management / Risk Management
- **Type**: Process SOP
- **Applicable To**: Product Managers, Project Leads, Engineering Leads
- **Company Stage**: All stages
- **Difficulty**: Beginner

## Overview
A pre-mortem is a proactive risk identification session conducted early in a project's life. Unlike a post-mortem (conducted after failure), a pre-mortem imagines failure in advance to surface concerns that team members might otherwise hesitate to raise. The key insight: **If you do a pre-mortem right, you won't have to do an ugly post-mortem.**

## When to Use
- Kicking off an important project or launch
- Starting work with high stakes or high uncertainty
- When the team seems hesitant about something
- Before major product launches
- Any time you want to surface hidden concerns

## Prerequisites
- A defined project or initiative
- Team members who will be involved
- 30-60 minutes for the session
- A shared document or template

## Core Concept: The Power of the Prompt

**The genius of the pre-mortem is the initial prompt:**

> "Imagine this project has failed miserably six months from now. What went wrong?"

**Why this works:**
1. **Psychological safety**: Gives permission to be negative
2. **Future framing**: Removes immediate defensiveness
3. **Collective imagination**: Surfaces concerns people were hesitant to raise
4. **Catharsis**: Team feels lighter after voicing concerns

## Procedure

### Step 1: Schedule the Meeting

**Timing**: Early in project lifecycle
- After project is defined but before deep execution
- Ideally 1-2 weeks after kickoff

**Duration**: 30-60 minutes depending on project size

**Attendees**: All key stakeholders
- Engineering leads and engineers
- Product managers
- Designers
- For large launches: Go-to-market teams (sales, support, marketing)

### Step 2: Set Up the Template

Create a shared document with three categories:

| Category | Definition | Icon |
|----------|------------|------|
| **Tiger** | A real threat that could kill us | 🐅 |
| **Paper Tiger** | A seeming threat others worry about, but you're not worried | 📄🐅 |
| **Elephant** | The elephant in the room nobody is talking about | 🐘 |

**Template structure:**
```
# Pre-Mortem: [Project Name]
Date: [Date]
Attendees: [Names]

## Tigers 🐅
(Threats that could actually kill us)

## Paper Tigers 📄🐅
(Things others are worried about, but you're not)

## Elephants 🐘
(Things nobody is talking about)

## Most Concerning (Voting)

## Action Plan
```

### Step 3: Open with the Prompt

**Leader says:**
> "Imagine it's [6 months from now]. This project has failed miserably. We're sitting in a room trying to figure out what went wrong. Let's work backwards from that failure and identify what could have caused it."

**Key framing:**
- We're assuming failure, not hoping for it
- This is about being thorough, not negative
- Everyone has permission to raise concerns

### Step 4: Silent Brainstorming (5-10 minutes)

**Instructions:**
- Everyone writes independently
- Don't show others your items yet
- Include Tigers, Paper Tigers, and Elephants
- 3-5 items per person is typical

**During silence:**
- No talking
- No looking at others' screens
- Focus on YOUR concerns

### Step 5: Share and Discuss (20-30 minutes)

**Go around the room:**
1. Each person shares one Tiger
2. Brief clarifying questions only (no debate)
3. Add to shared document
4. Continue until all Tigers shared
5. Repeat for Paper Tigers and Elephants

**Facilitator notes:**
- No "I agree" or "I disagree"
- Just listen and document
- Save evaluation for later

### Step 6: Vote on Most Concerning (5 minutes)

**Ask each person:**
> "Which Tiger (that someone else mentioned) do you find most scary?"

**Voting rules:**
- Can't vote for your own items
- One vote per person
- Tally votes in document

### Step 7: Create Action Plan

**For high-vote Tigers:**
1. Assign an owner
2. Define mitigation action
3. Set due date
4. Add to project tracking

**Format:**
| Tiger | Owner | Mitigation | Due Date |
|-------|-------|------------|----------|
| [Risk] | [Name] | [Action] | [Date] |

### Step 8: Share the Output

**After the meeting:**
- Clean up the document
- Share with the team
- Track mitigations in project plan
- Reference in future discussions

## Creating Shared Vocabulary

**Long-term benefit**: Teams develop shared language for risks

**In future meetings:**
- "I have a Tiger about this"
- "This feels like a Paper Tiger to me"
- "There's an Elephant we're not discussing"

This vocabulary makes it safe to raise concerns anytime.

## Expected Outcomes
- Hidden concerns surfaced before they become problems
- Reduced likelihood of ugly post-mortems
- Team feels heard and involved
- Proactive risk mitigation
- Shared vocabulary for discussing concerns

## Common Pitfalls

### Skipping the silent brainstorm
- Speaking first biases everyone
- Independent thinking surfaces more concerns
- Silence is essential

### Turning it into a debate
- Pre-mortem is for surfacing, not solving
- Debate happens later when creating action plan
- "I disagree" shuts people down

### Not following through on actions
- Pre-mortem without action is theater
- Must assign owners and track mitigations
- Otherwise, concerns weren't really heard

### Doing it too late
- Pre-mortem should happen EARLY
- Late pre-mortems can't prevent problems
- Ideal: 1-2 weeks into project

### Not including all stakeholders
- Engineers see different risks than PMs
- Go-to-market sees different risks than product
- Include everyone who touches the project

## Template (Coda/Notion Format)

**Pre-mortem for [Project Name]**

**Prompt:** Imagine this project has failed miserably 6 months from now. What went wrong?

**Tigers** (Real threats that could kill us):
- [Name]: [Concern]
- [Name]: [Concern]

**Paper Tigers** (Seeming threats you're NOT worried about):
- [Name]: [Concern] - [Why you're not worried]

**Elephants** (Things nobody is talking about):
- [Name]: [Concern]

**Top Concerns** (by vote):
1. [Tiger] - X votes
2. [Tiger] - X votes

**Action Plan:**
| Risk | Owner | Action | Due |
|------|-------|--------|-----|

- Post-Mortem Process

## AI Integration Notes

### Context signals that should trigger this SOP:
- User mentions "project kickoff," "launch planning"
- Questions about risk management
- Team hesitation or unvoiced concerns
- Major product launch preparation

### How to facilitate:
- Provide the template
- Guide through each step
- Emphasize psychological safety
- Help prioritize action items

### Key insight:
The pre-mortem is cheap insurance. One hour of structured concern-surfacing can prevent weeks of firefighting.
