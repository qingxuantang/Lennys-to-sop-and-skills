- **Company Stage**: All stages (especially critical at growth stage)
- **Tool Context**: Can be done with any system, optimized for product management tools like ProdPad

## Overview
This SOP provides a framework for managing incoming feature requests and ideas in a way that prevents the "build trap" (just building what's asked for without strategic thinking). It emphasizes capturing the underlying problems rather than solutions, connecting requests to roadmap items, and creating a thoughtful process that helps teams become better product managers through the structure itself.

## When to Use
- When your backlog is full of random feature requests
- When sales, customers, or execs constantly ask you to build their ideas
- When you're drowning in ideas and don't know how to prioritize
- When you need to track where ideas came from but want to focus on problems
- When implementing a new roadmapping framework (like Now-Next-Later)
- When transitioning from feature-factory to product-led culture
- When you need to show stakeholders their ideas are being considered

## Prerequisites
- Basic understanding of problem-based vs. solution-based thinking
- Roadmap framework in place (Now-Next-Later or similar)
- System for capturing ideas (can be as simple as a spreadsheet)
- Buy-in from team on the importance of understanding underlying problems
- Willingness to push back on "just build this" requests

## Procedure

### Step 1: Capture Ideas, Don't Commit to Building
**Mental model shift:**

**Old approach (build trap):**
- Someone suggests feature → Add to backlog → Feel obligated to build it
- Backlog becomes graveyard of ideas
- Guilt about not building everything

**New approach:**
- Someone suggests feature → Capture it → Dig for the problem → Connect to strategy
- Ideas become input for discovery, not commitments
- No guilt - you're being thoughtful, not negligent

**Key principle**: Capturing ≠ Committing

### Step 2: Ask Thoughtful Questions When Capturing Ideas
**Design your idea capture system to force better thinking:**

Instead of just capturing "Build X feature", require:

**Question 1: What problem does this solve?**
- Forces shift from solution to problem
- Example: "Build advanced search" → "Users can't find their archived documents"

**Question 2: Who has this problem?**
- Identifies user segment
- Helps prioritize based on strategic customer segments
- Example: "Power users in teams of 10+"

**Question 3: Why do you want to solve it?**
- Uncovers business value or user impact
- Helps prioritize based on outcomes
- Example: "Users are leaving because they lose important work"

**Question 4: What outcome would solving this achieve?**
- Focuses on measurable results
- Example: "Reduce churn by 10%" or "Increase daily active usage"

**Question 5: Where did this come from?**
- Track source (customer name, sales rep, exec, etc.)
- Helps follow up and show you listened
- Identifies patterns across sources

**Tool implementation**: If your tool asks these questions by default, it becomes difficult to fall into build-trap patterns.

### Step 3: Connect Ideas to Roadmap Problems
**Create a two-way link:**

**From Ideas to Roadmap:**
- Group similar ideas by underlying problem
- "We have 15 requests about finding documents" → Roadmap problem: "Document findability"
- Multiple ideas validate a problem is worth solving

**From Roadmap to Ideas:**
- Each roadmap item should connect to supporting ideas/feedback
- Shows evidence for why this problem matters
- Provides context when you start building solution

**Workflow:**
1. New idea comes in with problem described
2. Check: Do we already have this problem on the roadmap?
   - Yes → Link idea to that roadmap item
   - No → Is this problem significant enough to add? (See Step 5)
3. Tag idea with relevant information (customer segment, source, etc.)
4. Update roadmap item with additional context from idea

### Step 4: Avoid Building "Ideas Graveyard" Backlog
**Common problem**: Backlog with 500 feature requests, most will never be built.

**Better approach:**

**Archive ideas that:**
- Don't align with strategy
- Solve problems for non-target customers
- Are superseded by better solutions
- Haven't been requested in 12+ months

**Keep ideas that:**
- Relate to problems on roadmap (NOW, NEXT, or LATER)
- Represent valid problems for strategic customer segments
- Provide ongoing evidence for roadmap prioritization

**Review regularly:**
- Monthly: Review ideas added this month
- Quarterly: Review all active ideas, archive outdated ones
- Use idea age as a signal: If it's been there 18 months and never prioritized, probably not important

**Key principle**: Your idea backlog should be curated input for roadmap thinking, not a complete list of everything anyone ever mentioned.

### Step 5: Decide When to Add New Problems to Roadmap
**Not every idea deserves a roadmap item.**

**Criteria for adding to roadmap:**

**Volume signal:**
- Multiple independent sources reporting same problem
- Example: 10+ customers mention document search issues

**Strategic fit:**
- Aligns with product vision and strategy
- Serves target customer segment
- Supports business goals/OKRs

**Impact potential:**
- Significant user pain or business value
- Measurable outcome if solved
- Can articulate success metrics

**Feasibility:**
- Within capabilities of team
- Not dependent on unavailable technology
- Reasonable effort/value ratio

**Decision framework:**
- 1-2 requests for a problem → Capture in ideas, don't add to roadmap yet
- 3-5 requests + strategic fit → Consider for LATER column
- 5+ requests + high impact → Consider for NEXT column
- Critical blocker for key customers + strategic → Consider for NOW column

### Step 6: Respond to Requesters Without Committing
**What to say when someone asks for a feature:**

**Immediate response (while capturing):**
"Thanks for sharing this. Help me understand the problem you're trying to solve..."
[Ask the thoughtful questions from Step 2]

**After capturing:**
"I've added this to our product ideas. We look at these when we're doing roadmap planning. I can't commit to building it, but I can commit to thinking through whether it's the right priority for us."

**If it aligns with existing roadmap problem:**
"This is great timing - we're actually exploring solutions to [problem] right now. I'd love to talk to you more about your specific situation. Can we schedule 30 minutes?"

**If it doesn't align with strategy:**
"I understand this would help you, but it's not aligned with our focus on [strategy]. Here's what we are focusing on and why: [brief explanation]."

**For executives/important stakeholders:**
"I've captured this and I want to make sure I understand the full context. Let's schedule time to discuss the problem and outcomes you're looking for."

**Key principle**: Acknowledge the request, dig into the problem, don't commit to solutions.

### Step 7: Use Experiments to Validate Ideas
**Before adding to NOW column, consider experimentation:**

**Low-effort validation techniques:**
- Customer interviews: Talk to 5-10 customers who mentioned this problem
- Prototype testing: Show mockup to gauge interest
- Survey: Ask broader customer base about problem severity
- Usage data: Look for evidence of problem in current behavior
- Competitive analysis: See how others solve this

**Decision after validation:**
- Strong validation → Move to NOW or NEXT
- Weak validation → Keep in LATER or archive
- Unclear → Run more experiments

**Track experiments in your system:**
- Link experiments to ideas and roadmap items
- Document what you learned
- Show stakeholders you're doing due diligence

**Example flow:**
1. 5 customers request "better notifications"
2. Add problem to LATER: "Users miss important updates"
3. Interview 10 customers about update-awareness
4. Learn: Real problem is too many notifications, not too few
5. Update roadmap problem: "Users overwhelmed by notifications"
6. Solution: Reduce notifications, not add more
7. Link back to original ideas showing how you addressed underlying need

### Step 8: Report Back on Ideas Status
**Close the loop with requesters:**

**When you ship something related:**
"Remember when you suggested [idea]? We just shipped [solution] which solves the [problem] you mentioned. Would love to get your feedback on whether this addresses your need."

**When you decide not to pursue:**
"Thanks for suggesting [idea]. After researching the problem, we decided to focus on [different priority] because [reasoning]. Here's what we're doing instead: [explanation]."

**Regular updates to key stakeholders:**
- Monthly: "Here's what we heard from customers this month and how it's influencing our thinking..."
- Show how ideas are feeding into roadmap
- Highlight ideas that led to roadmap changes

**For archived ideas:**
"We've had [idea] in our backlog for 18 months without prioritizing it. That's a signal it's not aligned with our strategy. I'm archiving it, but if the situation changes, we can revisit."

### Step 9: Build Discovery Process Around Ideas
**Use ideas as starting point for discovery:**

**When problem moves from NEXT to NOW:**
1. Review all linked ideas
2. Identify customers/users who submitted them
3. Reach out for discovery interviews
4. Use their problems as research starting point
5. Go broader to understand full scope

**Benefits:**
- Built-in list of interview candidates
- Context on what triggered the research
- Stakeholders see their input being used
- Faster discovery (don't start from scratch)

**Discovery process:**
1. Roadmap problem: "Users can't collaborate effectively"
2. Linked ideas: 20 ideas about sharing, co-editing, commenting, etc.
3. Reach out to 10 requesters for interviews
4. Learn about collaboration workflows
5. Discover solution space
6. Build and test prototypes
7. Ship solution
8. Follow up with original requesters

### Step 10: Measure Success of Completed Roadmap Items
**Create accountability loop:**

**After shipping solution, track:**
- Did it solve the problem? (Talk to users)
- Did it achieve expected outcome? (Check metrics)
- What did we learn?
- Would we do it again?

**Document in your system:**
- Mark roadmap item as "completed"
- Add success/failure notes
- Link to metrics dashboard
- Tag lessons learned

**Use for future prioritization:**
- "Last time we prioritized [type of problem], we got [result]"
- "Our success rate on [category] is 70%, so let's be confident there"
- "We learned [lesson], so let's apply that to [current problem]"

**Share learnings:**
- Show stakeholders what worked and what didn't
- Build trust through transparency
- Demonstrate thoughtful, learning-oriented approach

## Expected Outcomes
- Ideas captured with rich context (problem, user, outcome)
- Clear connection between ideas and roadmap
- No guilt about "ignored" backlog
- Stakeholders feel heard even when ideas aren't built
- Discovery process has clear starting points
- Team thinks in problems, not features
- Better prioritization based on evidence
- Closed feedback loop with requesters
- System encourages better product management practices

## Common Pitfalls

### Pitfall 1: Capturing Solutions Instead of Problems
**Anti-pattern**: Idea log full of "Build X" with no understanding of why.

**Solution**:
- Make problem question required field
- Train team to ask "why" multiple times
- Review new ideas weekly to ensure quality
- Send back poorly-formed ideas for more detail

### Pitfall 2: Never Saying No or Archiving Ideas
**Anti-pattern**: Backlog grows to 1000+ items, becomes overwhelming.

**Solution**:
- Regular pruning (quarterly minimum)
- Archive anything 12+ months old and unprioritized
- Be honest: If you haven't built it in a year, you're probably not going to
- Focus on active roadmap-connected ideas

### Pitfall 3: Treating All Ideas Equally
**Anti-pattern**: Request from CEO gets same treatment as random user suggestion.

**Solution**:
- Tag ideas with source importance
- Have different SLAs for response (exec = same day, regular user = weekly)
- Still require same thoughtful questions
- Don't auto-prioritize exec ideas, but do give them thorough consideration

### Pitfall 4: Building Everything That Gets Requested
**Anti-pattern**: Customer asks → you build → repeat without strategy.

**Solution**:
- Ideas are input, not orders
- Validate before committing
- Check strategic alignment
- Be willing to say "not now" or "not ever"

### Pitfall 5: Not Closing the Loop
**Anti-pattern**: Ideas go into black hole, requesters never hear back.

**Solution**:
- Set expectation upfront about process
- Send updates when status changes
- Reach out when you ship related features
- Explain when you decide not to pursue

### Pitfall 6: Confusing Ideas with Roadmap
**Anti-pattern**: Treating idea backlog as your roadmap.

**Solution**:
- Ideas = possible solutions and problem indicators
- Roadmap = strategic problems you're committing to solve
- Ideas inform roadmap, not replace it
- Roadmap should be 10-20 items max, ideas can be hundreds

## Examples

### Example: Idea Capture Template

```markdown
**Idea**: Advanced search with filters

**Problem this solves**:
Users can't find their archived documents. They remember roughly when they created something or who they shared it with, but can't locate it, leading to lost work and frustration.

**Who has this problem**:
Power users who have 100+ documents, especially in team environments

**Why solve it**:
We're seeing 15% churn among users who hit 50+ documents. Exit interviews mention "couldn't find my stuff" as top 3 reason for leaving.

**Expected outcome**:
Reduce churn for power users by 50%, increase document creation rate (if users trust they can find things later, they'll create more)

**Source**:
Customer: Acme Corp (via Sarah in Sales), also mentioned by 8 other customers this quarter

**Related roadmap item**:
"Document findability problem" (NEXT column)

**Status**:
Active - feeding into discovery for document findability

**Experiments**:
- Interviewed 5 customers who mentioned this (link to notes)
- Prototype tested filter UI with 10 users
- 8/10 said this would solve their problem

### Example: Responding to Feature Request

**Incoming request (via email):**
"We really need the ability to export documents to PDF. Our legal team requires this and it's blocking our rollout to that department."

**Response:**
"Thanks for sharing this - I want to make sure I understand the full picture.

A few questions:
- What does your legal team do with the PDFs after export?
- Is this about preserving formatting, having offline copies, or something else?
- How often would they need to do this?
- Are there workarounds you're using today?

I'm asking because sometimes the solution we think we need isn't the best way to solve the underlying problem. I've captured this in our product ideas and I want to make sure we're solving the right problem for you.

Can we schedule 30 minutes this week to discuss?"

**After learning more, you discover:**
The real problem is legal needs to lock documents after certain milestones. PDF export is their assumed solution, but version control with locking would be better. You update the idea to reflect the real problem and connect it to your "Document workflow controls" roadmap item.

## AI Integration Notes

### Context Signals That Should Trigger This SOP
- User asks "how to manage feature requests"
- Discussion about "backlog management"
- Questions about "prioritizing ideas"
- Mentions "stakeholders asking for features"
- User overwhelmed by "too many ideas"
- Discussion of "build trap" or "feature factory"
- Questions about "idea management tools"

### How to Adapt for Different Situations
- **Small startups**: Can be very informal (Trello or Notion), but still ask the questions
- **Large enterprises**: May need formal intake process, service level agreements, governance
- **Sales-driven orgs**: Need strong process to prevent becoming feature factory for biggest customers
- **Consumer products**: May get ideas from community forums, app reviews - need aggregation
- **B2B products**: Often ideas come from sales - need to distinguish "this customer" vs. "market need"

### Limitations and Edge Cases
- **Contracted features**: If you sold something, you may have to build it (but still ask questions to build it right)
- **Regulatory requirements**: May not be optional, but still understand the problem space
- **Platform/ecosystem**: May need to build what partners request to support ecosystem health
- **Emergency requests**: Critical bugs or security issues skip this process
- **Very small teams**: May not need formal system, but still need discipline around asking questions

### Tool Recommendations
From Janna's context (building ProdPad):
- Good tools make it difficult to do bad product management
- System should force you to answer "what problem does this solve?"
- Should connect ideas to roadmap items automatically
- Should prompt for outcomes and success criteria
- Should make it easy to archive old ideas
- Should track source and allow closing the loop

Can be implemented in:
- Dedicated product tools (ProdPad, ProductBoard, Aha)
- Project management tools (Jira, Asana, Linear) with custom fields
- Simple tools (Notion, Airtable) with discipline
- Even spreadsheet with the right columns
