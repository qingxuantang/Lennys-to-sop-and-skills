# Now-Next-Later Roadmap Framework

## Metadata
- **Source**: Janna Bastow - Lenny's Podcast
- **Domain**: Product Management / Roadmapping
- **Type**: Framework
- **Applicable To**: Product Managers, Product Leaders, Startup Founders
- **Difficulty**: Beginner to Intermediate
- **Company Stage**: All stages (especially effective at early to growth stage)

## Overview
The Now-Next-Later roadmap framework replaces traditional timeline-based (Gantt) roadmaps with a three-column approach that acknowledges the cone of uncertainty. Instead of assigning dates to everything, this framework organizes work into flexible buckets: what's happening now (weeks), what's next (months), and what's later (longer term), allowing teams to be more honest about uncertainty while maintaining strategic clarity.

## When to Use
- When stakeholders constantly ask to move roadmap items "by a month"
- When your team consistently misses timeline commitments on roadmaps
- When you need flexibility without losing strategic direction
- When you want to reduce the overhead of constant roadmap updates
- When moving from waterfall to more agile/lean product development
- When you need to communicate uncertainty honestly to stakeholders

## Prerequisites
- Basic understanding of product management principles
- Stakeholder buy-in that not everything needs a fixed date
- Understanding of the cone of uncertainty concept
- Comfort with problem-based thinking vs. feature-based thinking

## Procedure

### Step 1: Understand the Core Problem with Timeline Roadmaps
**Why timeline roadmaps fail:**
- As soon as you have a timeline on the X-axis, everything underneath gets assigned a due date or iteration
- The further out you plan, the more you're making things up
- Teams never deliver everything on time, but assume it's their fault
- No one (not even experienced PMs) actually delivers roadmaps in the timeframe they promise
- Timeline roadmaps force false precision on inherently uncertain work

**Key insight**: If better product managers also can't deliver timeline roadmaps on schedule, the problem is the format, not the execution.

### Step 2: Set Up Your Three Columns
Create three buckets with the following characteristics:

**NOW Column:**
- Timeframe: Weeks (typically current sprint or next 2-4 weeks)
- Specificity: Highly specific and detailed
- Commitment level: High confidence
- Can include: Specific dates if needed
- Contains: Problems being actively worked on now

**NEXT Column:**
- Timeframe: Months (next 1-3 months typically)
- Specificity: Moderate detail
- Commitment level: Medium confidence
- Contains: Problems queued up to tackle soon
- Flexibility: Order may change based on learning

**LATER Column:**
- Timeframe: Longer term (3+ months out)
- Specificity: Less granular
- Commitment level: Lower confidence - these are assumptions
- Contains: Strategic problems to explore
- Flexibility: Highest - expect significant changes

### Step 3: Populate with Problems, Not Solutions
For each column, focus on the problems you're solving rather than specific features:
- Frame items as customer problems or business outcomes
- Example: "Users can't find their archived documents" instead of "Build advanced search"
- Include context on why each problem matters
- Add information about the opportunity size where relevant

### Step 4: Selectively Add Dates Only When Necessary
You don't have to live in "la la land" - add dates strategically:

**When to add dates:**
- Regulatory deadlines (e.g., GDPR compliance)
- Seasonal business needs (e.g., Christmas rush for retail)
- Academic cycles (for education products)
- Contractual obligations
- Conference demos or public commitments

**How to handle dated items:**
- Add significant buffer time
- Plan for soft launch well before the hard deadline
- Do extra project planning work for date-driven items
- Account for iteration and fixing time

### Step 5: Implement Soft Launch vs. Hard Launch Separation
**Soft Launch (Developer timeline):**
- When developers can actually ship the feature
- May slip by days or weeks - that's okay
- Internal or limited beta release
- Focused on getting it working

**Hard Launch (Marketing timeline):**
- Happens AFTER soft launch is complete
- Marketing works with the real, functional product
- Can take days, weeks, or months after soft launch
- Creates better marketing materials (real screenshots, testimonials, videos)
- Eliminates pressure to coordinate two different project types

**Benefits:**
- Developers aren't rushed by marketing deadlines
- Marketing gets actual working product to promote
- Can gather real user feedback before big announcement
- Reduces risk of promising something that changes

### Step 6: Treat Roadmap as Prototype for Strategy
**Mental model shift:**
- The value isn't the roadmap, it's the roadmapping process
- Just like a feature prototype, a roadmap is for checking assumptions
- Share early roadmap assumptions with team and customers
- Expect to throw out and remake the roadmap based on feedback
- Ask: "I think we have this problem, then this problem. What do you think?"

**Roadmapping as prototyping:**
- Lay out your assumptions about problem priority
- Share with stakeholders, team, even customers
- Gather feedback: "What's missing? What's wrong?"
- Adjust the roadmap based on learning
- Repeat regularly

### Step 7: Communicate the Framework to Stakeholders
**To executives/board:**
- "We're not asking for more leeway than your sales team"
- Sales invests in a team and runs experiments (calls), some work, some don't
- Product invests in a team and runs experiments (features/changes), some work, some don't
- Sales doesn't promise which specific deals will close when, just that deals will close
- Product shouldn't promise which specific features will ship when, just that outcomes will be achieved
- Both should be accountable for what they did and what results they got

**To sales/marketing:**
- Regular launch readiness meetings for what's in NOW column
- Soft launch gives them real product to work with
- Hard launch can happen on their timeline
- They're marketing what's already built, not vapor ware

### Step 8: Update and Maintain
- Move items from Later → Next → Now as you learn more
- Remove items that no longer make sense
- Don't be afraid to reorder based on new information
- Regularly review with team (weekly/bi-weekly for Now, monthly for Next/Later)
- Update stakeholders on what moved and why

## Expected Outcomes
- Reduced stress around missed deadlines
- More honest conversations about uncertainty
- Faster execution (less time planning to the nth degree)
- Better stakeholder trust (because you're honest about what you know/don't know)
- More flexibility to respond to new information
- Marketing launches based on real products, not promises
- Development team focused on building, not justifying date slips

## Common Pitfalls

### Pitfall 1: Letting Stakeholders Demand Dates on Everything
**Anti-pattern**: Adding dates to every item because someone senior asked for them.

**Solution**:
- Educate stakeholders on the framework first
- Compare to how sales works (experiments, not guarantees)
- Start with one team/division to prove it works
- Show data on how many items actually shipped on time with old method

### Pitfall 2: Making Now/Next/Later Too Vague
**Anti-pattern**: Using the flexibility as an excuse to never commit to anything.

**Solution**:
- Be specific about what's in NOW - these should ship in weeks
- Include outcomes and success metrics
- Have regular reviews to show progress
- Use soft/hard launch to give concrete milestones

### Pitfall 3: Keeping Timeline Mindset with Different Labels
**Anti-pattern**: Treating "Now" as "this month," "Next" as "next month," etc. - just hiding the timeline.

**Solution**:
- Focus on problems and outcomes, not features
- Allow items to stay in a column longer if needed
- Move based on learning, not calendar
- Explain this is about confidence level, not time periods

### Pitfall 4: Not Separating Soft and Hard Launch
**Anti-pattern**: Still trying to coordinate development completion with marketing launch.

**Solution**:
- Make it explicit: developers ship when ready
- Marketing starts planning only after soft launch
- Set expectation that these are different project types
- Celebrate soft launches as wins

### Pitfall 5: Creating Roadmap in PowerPoint/Slides First
**Anti-pattern**: Building the visual roadmap before thinking through the strategy.

**Solution**:
- Start with story points and narratives
- Figure out what you're actually trying to say
- Use Post-It notes or simple columns first
- Add visuals to support the narrative, not drive it

## Examples

### Bad Timeline Roadmap:
```
Q1: Advanced search (Jan 15), User profiles (Feb 28), Export feature (Mar 30)
Q2: API v2 (Apr 15), Mobile app (Jun 30)
```
*Problems: False precision, likely to slip, forces features not outcomes*

### Good Now-Next-Later Roadmap:
```
NOW:
- Problem: Users lose track of their documents (soft launch by end of month)
- Problem: Teams can't collaborate on shared files

NEXT:
- Problem: Power users need to access our data in other tools
- Problem: Mobile users can't do core workflows on the go

LATER:
- Explore: Integration ecosystem strategy
- Explore: International expansion requirements
```
*Benefits: Problem-focused, honest about certainty, flexible*

## AI Integration Notes

### Context Signals That Should Trigger This SOP
- User mentions "roadmap" + "constantly changing dates"
- User asks "how to create a product roadmap"
- Discussion about "stakeholder pressure for dates"
- User struggling with "missed commitments"
- Mentions "Gantt chart roadmap" problems

### How to Adapt for Different Situations
- **Early-stage startups**: Emphasize flexibility, shorter time horizons (Now = this week, Next = next few weeks)
- **Enterprise products**: May need more structure in Now column, longer time horizons
- **Regulated industries**: More items in Later will eventually need dates when compliance deadlines approach
- **Hardware/physical products**: Acknowledge some constraints require more upfront planning, but still use framework for software portions

### Limitations and Edge Cases
- Not suitable for: Construction projects, manufacturing with long lead times, projects with hard external dependencies
- Requires organizational culture shift - may face resistance
- Works best in environments that embrace uncertainty and iteration
- May need executive sponsorship to implement at larger companies
- Some stakeholders may never be comfortable without dates (may need parallel communication)

### Integration with Other Frameworks
- Combines well with: OKRs (Later items become future OKRs), Continuous Discovery, Lean/Agile
- May conflict with: Traditional project management (Gantt, critical path), fixed-scope contracts
