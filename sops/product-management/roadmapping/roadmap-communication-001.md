## Overview
This SOP outlines how to effectively communicate your product roadmap internally and externally, treating the roadmap presentation as a conversation and learning opportunity rather than a one-way commitment. The approach emphasizes starting with narrative before visuals, using roadmaps to gather feedback, and adapting communication style to different audiences while maintaining transparency about uncertainty.

## When to Use
- Preparing for roadmap presentations (all-hands, board meetings, customer sessions)
- Creating roadmap documentation or slides
- Responding to roadmap questions from stakeholders
- Running roadmap review meetings
- Sharing roadmap updates after significant changes
- Onboarding new team members or stakeholders to your roadmap process
- Defending roadmap approach when challenged

## Prerequisites
- Clear understanding of your product strategy
- Roadmap structure in place (even if just Post-It notes)
- Understanding of your audience's needs and concerns
- Problems/outcomes defined for roadmap items
- Willingness to receive and incorporate feedback

## Procedure

### Step 1: Start with Narrative, Not Slides
**Don't begin in PowerPoint/Slides:**

**The wrong approach:**
- Opening PowerPoint and starting to build slides
- Getting stuck in "presentation mode"
- Trying to fit narrative to slides
- Spending hours on formatting before clarity

**The right approach:**
- Start with Post-It notes on a wall
- Write out your story points and narratives
- Figure out what you're actually trying to say
- Arrange problems in order of priority
- Get feedback from team on paper/Post-Its
- THEN create slides to support the narrative

**Key principle**: The slides should follow naturally from a clear narrative, not drive it.

### Step 2: Frame the Roadmap as a Prototype
**Opening framing for any roadmap presentation:**

"I want to share our current thinking on the roadmap. Think of this as a prototype for our strategy - just like we prototype features to test our assumptions, we're prototyping our strategic direction. The value here isn't in having a perfect plan, it's in the conversation we're about to have."

**Why this works:**
- Sets expectation that roadmap can and should change
- Invites feedback rather than defending a position
- Reduces anxiety about precision
- Creates psychological safety for honest discussion

**Follow with:**
"I'm going to lay out our assumptions about the problems we think we should solve in order. I need your help checking whether we're on the right path."

### Step 3: Lead with Problems, Not Solutions
**Structure your roadmap communication around problems:**

**Instead of:**
"We're building an advanced search feature in Q2, then an API in Q3"

**Say:**
"We're seeing users struggle to find their archived documents - they're losing important work. After we solve that, we're hearing from power users that they can't access our data in their other tools, which is limiting adoption with larger teams."

**Benefits:**
- Creates empathy for user problems
- Makes priorities defensible
- Invites discussion about whether these are the right problems
- Easier to adapt solution once you start building

**Template:**
- "We're seeing [user segment] struggle with [problem]"
- "This is costing them [impact/pain]"
- "We believe solving this will [outcome]"

### Step 4: Tailor Communication to Audience
**For each stakeholder group, emphasize different aspects:**

**Executives/Board:**
- Time allocation: 5 min setup, 10 min NOW, 5 min NEXT, 10 min LATER, 10 min discussion
- Lead with: How roadmap connects to business strategy/OKRs
- Emphasize: Outcomes, metrics, market positioning
- Show: Learning from last period, what changed and why
- Request: Strategic guidance on LATER column priorities

**Engineering Team:**
- Time allocation: 5 min context, 20 min NOW deep dive, 15 min NEXT, 10 min technical discussion
- Lead with: Why we're prioritizing this way
- Emphasize: Technical challenges, dependencies, debt items
- Show: How their input shaped priorities
- Request: Estimates, approach suggestions, concerns

**Sales/Marketing:**
- Time allocation: 5 min overview, 15 min NOW/soft launches, 10 min NEXT, 10 min positioning
- Lead with: What they can talk about with customers today
- Emphasize: Customer problems solved, value propositions
- Show: Soft launch timeline and readiness
- Request: Customer feedback on priorities, messaging input

**Customers (external):**
- Time allocation: Brief - 5 min themes, 5 min Q&A
- Lead with: You listened to their feedback
- Emphasize: Problem areas you're investing in (themes, not features)
- Show: Commitment to their success
- Avoid: Specific features or dates
- Request: Continued feedback

**All-hands/Company-wide:**
- Time allocation: 10 min total
- Lead with: Strategic context and wins from last period
- Emphasize: How everyone's work connects to roadmap
- Show: Customer impact stories
- Request: Ideas and feedback

### Step 5: Use Visual Hierarchy to Communicate Certainty
**Design roadmap presentations to show decreasing certainty:**

**NOW column:**
- More detail, larger text
- May include specific dates or timeframes
- Show launch readiness status
- Include: What's shipping this week/month

**NEXT column:**
- Medium detail, medium text
- Timeframes in months or quarters
- Show: Order and reasoning
- Include: What we're working on next

**LATER column:**
- Less detail, smaller text
- No specific timeframes
- Show: Strategic themes and areas of exploration
- Include: What we're considering

**Visual techniques:**
- Use color saturation: NOW is vibrant, LATER is faded
- Use size: NOW items larger, LATER items smaller
- Use specificity: NOW has details, LATER has themes
- Use language: NOW "We are...", NEXT "We're planning...", LATER "We're exploring..."

### Step 6: Present as Questions, Not Answers
**Engage the audience in thinking through the roadmap:**

**Instead of declarative statements:**
"We're doing X, then Y, then Z."

**Use collaborative framing:**
- "We're thinking the priority is X, then Y, then Z. What are we missing?"
- "Based on customer research, we believe this problem is most urgent. Does that match what you're hearing?"
- "We're considering these three options. What would you prioritize and why?"

**Active listening during presentation:**
- Pause after each major section for questions
- Actually write down feedback (on screen if possible)
- Acknowledge good points: "That's a great observation, we hadn't considered..."
- Commit to following up: "Let me look into that and get back to you"

**Key principle**: You want stakeholders thinking WITH you, not being presented TO.

### Step 7: Show Change as Learning, Not Failure
**When presenting roadmap updates:**

**Acknowledge what changed:**
"Last month we had [X] in the NOW column. That's moved to NEXT, and here's why..."

**Frame as learning:**
- "We discovered that customers actually need [Y] first before [X] makes sense"
- "The technical approach we planned won't scale, so we're taking a different approach that will take longer but be more robust"
- "Market feedback showed [Z] is a bigger opportunity than we thought"

**Show what you learned:**
- "We interviewed 20 customers and learned..."
- "Our experiment showed..."
- "The data revealed..."

**Demonstrate good judgment:**
"We could have pushed ahead with our original plan, but given what we learned, that would have been the wrong move. So we adjusted."

**Celebrate adaptability:**
"This is exactly why we don't commit to fixed timelines - so we can respond to new information and make better decisions."

### Step 8: Provide Regular Updates, Not Just Big Reveals
**Create a rhythm of communication:**

**Weekly (for team):**
- Slack/email update: "This week we shipped..., next week we're starting..., learned..."
- 5 minutes max
- Keeps roadmap top of mind

**Bi-weekly (for stakeholders):**
- Quick sync or written update
- What moved from NEXT to NOW
- Any adjustments to priorities
- Asks for input on decisions

**Monthly (for leadership):**
- 30-minute roadmap review
- Progress on NOW items
- Changes to NEXT/LATER and why
- Metrics update
- Strategic questions

**Quarterly (for all):**
- Comprehensive roadmap presentation
- Connect to business goals/OKRs
- Major strategic shifts
- Deep dive on learnings

**Benefits of regular updates:**
- No surprises
- Builds trust through transparency
- Changes feel incremental, not shocking
- Stakeholders feel included in journey

### Step 9: Handle Pushback and Difficult Questions
**Common challenges and responses:**

**"Can you commit to a date?"**
- "Is there a specific external constraint driving that date? If so, let's plan for it. If not, let me explain why dates on everything actually slows us down..."
- Use the sales team analogy

**"This keeps changing, how can we trust the roadmap?"**
- "The roadmap should change as we learn. Let me show you what we learned that led to this change..."
- "Would you prefer we stick to a plan we know is wrong?"

**"Why isn't [pet feature] on here?"**
- "Tell me more about the problem that would solve. Let's discuss whether it should be prioritized over [current items]."
- "We considered that. Here's why we prioritized [X] instead..."

**"Our competitor just launched X, why aren't we working on it?"**
- "Let's talk about whether our customers actually need that, or if we should continue focusing on [problem] which our research shows is more impactful."

**"The board wants more concrete plans"**
- "I can provide more detail on the NOW column. For NEXT and LATER, we're necessarily making educated bets. Let me show you our process for de-risking those bets..."

### Step 10: Close with Clear Next Steps
**End every roadmap presentation with:**

**Summary of feedback received:**
"Here's what I heard today: [list 3-5 key points]"

**What you'll do with it:**
"I'm going to: [specific actions]"
"I'll follow up on [specific questions] by [date]"

**What you need from them:**
"I need [input/decision/approval] on [specific item] by [date]"

**Next touchpoint:**
"We'll review this again on [date]"
"I'll send an update on [day/frequency]"

**Invitation for ongoing feedback:**
"If anything comes up before then, here's how to reach me..."

## Expected Outcomes
- Stakeholders understand current priorities and reasoning
- Feedback incorporated improves roadmap quality
- Less time defending roadmap, more time discussing strategy
- Psychological safety for roadmap to evolve
- Shared ownership of roadmap across teams
- Clear communication reduces hallway conversations and confusion
- Trust built through transparent, regular updates

## Common Pitfalls

### Pitfall 1: Creating Beautiful Slides with Weak Narrative
**Anti-pattern**: Spending hours on roadmap visuals before clarifying the story.

**Solution**:
- Start with Post-Its or simple text
- Get feedback on priority order first
- Build slides only after narrative is clear
- Remember: slides support story, don't drive it

### Pitfall 2: Presenting the Roadmap Like a Commitment Ceremony
**Anti-pattern**: Formal presentation with no opportunity for feedback or discussion.

**Solution**:
- Frame as prototype from the beginning
- Build in discussion time
- Ask questions throughout
- Actually incorporate feedback

### Pitfall 3: Same Presentation for All Audiences
**Anti-pattern**: Showing engineering-level detail to executives or strategic themes to engineers.

**Solution**:
- Tailor depth and focus to audience
- Emphasize what matters to them
- Adjust time allocation
- Use appropriate language/framing

### Pitfall 4: Hiding Changes or Presenting Them as Failures
**Anti-pattern**: Hoping no one notices you moved items around, or apologizing for changes.

**Solution**:
- Proactively call out changes
- Frame as learning and good judgment
- Show the data/insight that drove change
- Celebrate adaptability

### Pitfall 5: No Rhythm of Communication
**Anti-pattern**: Only presenting roadmap quarterly, leading to surprises and loss of alignment.

**Solution**:
- Establish regular update cadence
- Make updates lightweight, not formal events
- Consistency builds trust
- Frequent small updates > infrequent big reveals

### Pitfall 6: Defensiveness When Challenged
**Anti-pattern**: Taking questions as attacks, getting defensive about priorities.

**Solution**:
- Remember you want feedback
- Assume positive intent
- Ask clarifying questions
- Thank people for input, even if you disagree

## Examples

### Example: All-Hands Roadmap Update (10 minutes)

**[Slide 1: Last Quarter Wins]**
"Before we look ahead, let's celebrate what we shipped last quarter. We solved the document findability problem - users can now find archived work in under 5 seconds, down from 2+ minutes. This drove a 20% increase in daily active users. Thanks to the whole team for making this happen.

**[Slide 2: What We Learned]**
"We also learned something important. We were planning to build an advanced filtering system next, but when we talked to customers, we discovered the real problem is they can't collaborate on shared files. So we adjusted.

**[Slide 3: NOW]**
"This quarter we're focused on solving collaboration - specifically, multiple people being able to edit documents without losing work or getting confused about versions.

**[Slide 4: NEXT & LATER themes]**
"After that, we're looking at power user needs and integration ecosystem. But as always, we'll learn as we go and adjust.

**[Slide 5: How You Can Help]**
"If you talk to customers, please keep funneling feedback to the product team. Your insights directly shape these priorities. Questions?"

### Example: Board Meeting Roadmap Presentation (30 minutes)

**[5 minutes: Context & Strategy]**
"Our product strategy is to become the collaboration hub for distributed teams. This roadmap reflects our bets on the problems standing between us and that vision."

**[10 minutes: NOW - Current Quarter]**
"This quarter we're solving real-time collaboration. Here's the problem: [customer story]. We're measuring success by: [metrics]. We're running 3 experiments: [list]. Early results: [data]."

**[5 minutes: NEXT - Next Quarter]**
"Following collaboration, our customer research points to integration needs. We're exploring these options: [list]. We'll validate which problem to solve first through: [process]."

**[5 minutes: LATER - Strategic Bets]**
"Looking further out, we're watching these trends: [list]. Big question I need your input on: should we prioritize international expansion or enterprise features? Here's what we know: [data]."

**[5 minutes: Q&A]**

## AI Integration Notes

### Context Signals That Should Trigger This SOP
- User asks "how to present roadmap"
- Mentions "roadmap meeting" or "roadmap presentation"
- Questions about "communicating roadmap changes"
- Discussion of "roadmap feedback"
- User preparing for "board meeting" with roadmap component
- Asks about "different audiences for roadmap"

### How to Adapt for Different Situations
- **Remote teams**: Add tactics for virtual presentations (polls, chat, breakout rooms for discussion)
- **Large organizations**: May need more formal structure, but keep core principles
- **Startups**: Can be much more casual and frequent, daily updates may work
- **Technical audiences**: Show more implementation detail in NOW column
- **Non-technical audiences**: Use more analogies and customer stories
- **Hostile environments**: Start with soft launch of new approach with friendly stakeholders

### Limitations and Edge Cases
- Very large audiences (100+): May need to limit interactivity, use Q&A instead
- Recorded presentations: Can't adapt to real-time feedback, need to anticipate questions
- Cross-cultural: Directness of asking for feedback may need adjustment
- Highly hierarchical organizations: May need to brief senior leaders privately before group presentation
- Crisis situations: May need more directive communication vs. collaborative approach

### Integration with Public Speaking Best Practices
From Janna's public speaking advice:
- Practice presentation multiple times, including in shower, walking, etc.
- Record yourself and watch it back (even though it's uncomfortable)
- Do power pose before presentation for confidence
- Visit venue beforehand if possible
- Find friendly faces in audience to present to
- Start with story points, not slides
- Remember audience is rooting for you
