## Overview
This SOP provides a framework for aligning stakeholders around product roadmaps without making false promises about delivery dates. It treats the roadmap as a "prototype for your strategy" - a tool for checking assumptions and building shared understanding rather than a fixed commitment document. The approach focuses on managing expectations around uncertainty while maintaining stakeholder confidence.

## When to Use
- When presenting roadmaps to executives, board members, or investors
- When sales and marketing teams demand concrete delivery dates
- When stakeholders pressure you to commit to specific timelines
- During quarterly planning or strategy reviews
- When implementing a new roadmapping approach (like Now-Next-Later)
- When stakeholder trust is low due to past missed commitments
- When changing from timeline-based to problem-based roadmaps

## Prerequisites
- Clear understanding of your product strategy
- List of key stakeholders and their needs/concerns
- Understanding of the cone of uncertainty concept
- Basic roadmap structure (even if it's Post-It notes)
- Examples ready of how other teams (like sales) work with uncertainty

## Procedure

### Step 1: Reframe the Roadmap's Purpose
**Shift the mental model from plan to prototype:**

Share this framing with stakeholders:
- "The roadmap is a prototype for our strategy, not a fixed plan"
- "Just like we prototype features to check our assumptions, we prototype strategy to check our assumptions"
- "The value isn't in the roadmap document, it's in the roadmapping process"

**Key talking points:**
- At the feature level: You create a mockup, share it, get feedback, add a button or change copy, throw out the prototype, make a new one
- At the strategy level: You create a roadmap, share it, get feedback, adjust priorities, update the roadmap
- The value is in learning, not in the artifact

### Step 2: Compare Product to Sales (For Executives/Board)
When stakeholders demand dates and commitments, use the sales team analogy:

**The sales comparison:**
"We're not asking for more leeway than your sales team gets."

**Sales team approach:**
- VP Sales doesn't promise: "We'll close the Acme deal on October 31st for $1M"
- They can't know which specific deals will close or when
- Instead they promise: "Give me $250K for my team, they'll run experiments (calls), and we'll close ~$1M in deals this quarter"
- Some calls work, some fail - they don't know which ahead of time
- They're accountable for: investment spent, experiments run, results achieved

**Product team approach (should be the same):**
- Product doesn't promise: "We'll ship feature X on date Y"
- We can't know which experiments will succeed or exactly when
- Instead promise: "Give me $250K for my team, they'll run experiments (features/changes), and we'll move metrics in the right direction"
- Some experiments work, some fail - we don't know which ahead of time
- We're accountable for: investment spent, experiments run, results achieved

**What you ARE accountable for:**
- How many experiments you ran last quarter
- What numbers moved in the right direction
- How you spent your budget
- What you learned
- What you're doing differently based on learning

**What you're NOT accountable for:**
- Predicting which specific things will work before testing them
- Exact dates for uncertain work
- Delivering every feature on a list (some won't make sense after discovery)

### Step 3: Provide Regular Communication Cadence
**Establish predictable touchpoints:**

**Weekly/Bi-weekly:**
- Show what's in the NOW column
- Launch readiness meetings for items nearing completion
- Quick updates on what moved from Next → Now and why

**Monthly:**
- Review the full roadmap (Now, Next, Later)
- Explain what changed and why
- Share learnings from shipped items
- Gather stakeholder feedback on priorities

**Quarterly:**
- Strategic roadmap review
- Connect roadmap to business outcomes/OKRs
- Adjust Later column based on market changes
- Review success metrics from past quarter

**The key**: Predictability of communication reduces anxiety about lack of specific dates.

### Step 4: Separate Soft Launch from Hard Launch (For Sales/Marketing)
Help marketing and sales understand the two-phase launch approach:

**Soft Launch (Development-driven):**
- Developers ship when the feature is ready
- May be end of September or might slip to mid-October
- That's okay - marketing is busy with last month's launches anyway
- Released to limited users, beta testers, or internally
- Time to gather real usage, fix bugs, iterate

**Hard Launch (Marketing-driven):**
- Starts AFTER soft launch is complete
- Marketing now has real product to work with
- Can create: real screenshots, user testimonials, demo videos
- Can take 2 days, 6 days, 6 weeks, or 6 months to plan
- Marketing controls the timeline
- No pressure to coordinate two different project types

**Benefits to communicate:**
- Marketing gets better materials (real product, not mockups)
- Reduced risk of embarrassing changes between promise and delivery
- Marketing can plan properly instead of working with moving target
- Development stays focused on quality, not arbitrary dates

### Step 5: Handle Date Requests Strategically
**When stakeholders demand dates, use this decision tree:**

**Question 1: Is there a real external constraint?**
- Regulatory deadline (e.g., GDPR)? → Add date with significant buffer
- Seasonal business need (e.g., back-to-school)? → Add date with buffer
- Contractual obligation? → Add date with buffer
- No external constraint? → Continue to Question 2

**Question 2: What's driving the date request?**
- Need to plan marketing campaign? → Explain soft/hard launch separation
- Board wants to see progress? → Offer regular demos instead
- Sales needs to promise customers? → Explain experiments model
- Just "how we've always done it"? → Education opportunity

**Question 3: Can we provide a timeframe instead?**
- Instead of "June 15th" → "Q2" or "Summer"
- Instead of "March 1st" → "Early Q1"
- Instead of "December 31st" → "By end of year"

**If you must give a date:**
- Add 50-100% buffer
- Plan to soft launch well before the date
- Do extra project planning
- Make the exception clear (this is unusual because...)

### Step 6: Share Roadmap with Different Audiences
**Customize presentation for each stakeholder group:**

**For Executives/Board:**
- Focus on: Outcomes, business metrics, strategic bets
- Show: How roadmap connects to company OKRs/goals
- Emphasize: Learning velocity, experiment results
- Less detail on: Specific features or technical details

**For Sales Team:**
- Focus on: What's coming in NOW column, what they can sell today
- Show: Soft launch timeline for setting customer expectations
- Emphasize: Customer problems being solved
- Less detail on: Later column (too uncertain to promise)

**For Marketing Team:**
- Focus on: What's in soft launch now, what's coming to NOW soon
- Show: Launch readiness status
- Emphasize: Customer value proposition, differentiation
- Provide: Time to plan campaigns around real product

**For Engineering Team:**
- Focus on: Technical problems in NOW and NEXT
- Show: Dependencies, technical debt items
- Emphasize: Why we're prioritizing this way
- Include: Space for their input on estimates and approach

**For Customers (if sharing externally):**
- Focus on: Problems you're solving, not features
- Show: Themes and areas of investment
- Emphasize: That you listen to feedback
- Avoid: Specific features or dates (these create expectations)

### Step 7: Build Psychological Safety for Honest Updates
**Create an environment where reality is rewarded:**

**When things slip or change:**
- Lead with learning: "We discovered X, which changed our thinking"
- Show alternative path: "Instead of A, we're now doing B because..."
- Connect to outcomes: "This delay means we'll deliver higher quality"
- Ask for input: "Given this new information, what do you think?"

**Encourage stakeholder questions:**
- "What are we missing?"
- "What would you prioritize differently and why?"
- "What concerns do you have about this direction?"

**Regular retrospectives with stakeholders:**
- "What's working in our roadmapping process?"
- "What's not working?"
- "What should we change?"

### Step 8: Demonstrate Progress Without Fixed Dates
**Alternative ways to show momentum:**

**Show velocity of learning:**
- "Last quarter we ran 12 experiments"
- "We interviewed 50 customers about problem X"
- "We shipped 8 improvements to activation flow"

**Show outcome movement:**
- "Retention up 15% from Q1"
- "Customer satisfaction score increased to 4.2"
- "Revenue per user up $12"

**Show discovery rigor:**
- "Validated assumption X with 30 users"
- "Invalidated assumption Y, pivoted to Z"
- "Found new opportunity worth $2M annually"

**Regular demos:**
- Weekly or bi-weekly show-and-tells
- Invite all stakeholders
- Show what shipped, even small things
- Share user feedback

## Expected Outcomes
- Stakeholders understand and accept roadmap flexibility
- Reduced pressure for false precision on dates
- Marketing/sales can plan effectively with soft/hard launch model
- Executives have confidence in the process even without fixed dates
- Honest conversations about trade-offs and priorities
- Less time spent updating and explaining roadmap changes
- Higher trust between product team and stakeholders
- Better decisions based on actual learning vs. sticking to plan

## Common Pitfalls

### Pitfall 1: Introducing Change Without Education
**Anti-pattern**: Switching from timeline roadmap to Now-Next-Later without explaining why.

**Solution**:
- Schedule dedicated sessions to introduce the concept
- Share this SOP or articles about the approach
- Start with one stakeholder group to build advocates
- Use pilot period to prove the approach

### Pitfall 2: Being Too Vague to Seem Accountable
**Anti-pattern**: Hiding behind "it's all uncertain" without showing progress.

**Solution**:
- Be very specific about NOW column
- Show completed work regularly
- Track and share metrics
- Document experiments and learnings
- Be clear about what you ARE accountable for

### Pitfall 3: Not Addressing the Real Fear
**Anti-pattern**: Stakeholders aren't worried about dates, they're worried you don't have a plan.

**Solution**:
- Show your strategy clearly
- Explain the reasoning behind priorities
- Share your discovery process
- Demonstrate you're making thoughtful bets
- Regular updates build confidence

### Pitfall 4: Giving In on First Pushback
**Anti-pattern**: Reverting to timeline roadmap when one executive pushes back.

**Solution**:
- Expect resistance - plan for it
- Have the sales comparison ready
- Show data on past timeline accuracy
- Get peer support from other teams
- Start small and expand

### Pitfall 5: Overpromising on NOW Column
**Anti-pattern**: To compensate for uncertainty, promising everything in NOW will definitely ship this week.

**Solution**:
- Be honest: "This is high confidence, not guaranteed"
- Explain soft launch concept
- Keep NOW column reasonably sized
- Update quickly if something slips

## Examples

### Example: Executive Board Presentation Script

"I want to share how we think about our product roadmap. Rather than a fixed plan with dates, we treat it as a prototype for our strategy - a way to check our assumptions and learn.

Just like our VP of Sales can't promise exactly which deals will close when, but can promise to run a disciplined process that generates results, we're taking the same approach. Last quarter we invested $300K in the team, ran 15 experiments, and increased our key metric by 25%. This quarter we're focusing on three core problems [list them], and we'll continue this disciplined experimentation process.

I'll show you what we're working on now, what's next, and what we're exploring for later. I'll also show you how we decide what to work on and how we measure success."

### Example: Sales Team Communication

"Here's what's in our NOW column - these are shipping in the next few weeks:
- [Problem X solution] - soft launching end of this month, then you can start showing select customers
- [Problem Y solution] - in testing now, ready for early access next week

Here's what's NEXT - coming in the next few months:
- [Problem Z solution] - we'll have a soft launch 6-8 weeks out, then marketing will do the big launch

I know you'd love more specific dates, but here's what we've found works better: We soft launch first, get it working with real customers, then marketing does a proper launch with real product demos and testimonials. This way you're never promising something that hasn't been validated."

## AI Integration Notes

### Context Signals That Should Trigger This SOP
- User asks "how to present roadmap to executives"
- Discussion about "stakeholders demanding dates"
- Questions about "roadmap communication"
- User mentions "stakeholder alignment" or "buy-in"
- Mentions of "board meeting" + "roadmap"
- Concerns about "changing roadmap" or "missed commitments"

### How to Adapt for Different Situations
- **Startups with investors**: Emphasize learning velocity and outcome metrics more than established companies
- **Enterprise B2B**: May need more structure around NOW column commitments, but NEXT/LATER can still be flexible
- **Companies with poor track record**: Start with over-communication and frequent demos to rebuild trust
- **Highly regulated industries**: Acknowledge constraints but still apply framework to non-regulated portions
- **Sales-driven cultures**: The sales comparison is especially powerful - lean into it

### Limitations and Edge Cases
- May not work if: CEO/board fundamentally doesn't believe in agile/lean approach
- Requires: Some executive sponsorship or at least openness to experiment
- Cultural fit: Works better in learning-oriented cultures vs. command-and-control
- May need: Parallel communication strategy for resistant stakeholders while you prove the approach
- First quarter is hardest: You need to build trust through delivery before stakeholders relax on dates

### Signs It's Working
- Stakeholders ask "what are you learning?" instead of "when will it ship?"
- Fewer emergency meetings about date slips
- Marketing/sales proactively asking about soft launch status
- Executives reference the roadmap in strategy discussions
- Stakeholders contribute ideas to NEXT/LATER columns
- Less time spent defending roadmap, more time building product
