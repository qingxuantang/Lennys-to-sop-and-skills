## Overview
A framework for developing deep consumer product intuition based on Mike Krieger's experience building Instagram and Artifact. Focuses on understanding when growth is working vs. forcing it, recognizing viral mechanics, and knowing when to call a product that isn't working.

## When to Use
- Building or iterating on consumer-facing products
- Evaluating whether your product has natural growth momentum
- Deciding whether to persist or pivot on a consumer product
- Designing for organic sharing and network effects
- Assessing product-market fit for consumer apps

## Prerequisites
- Working consumer product with real users (even if small)
- Ability to track user behavior and growth metrics
- Understanding of your user acquisition funnel
- Honest assessment capability (not just optimism)

## Procedure

### Step 1: Recognize "Energy in the System"
Consumer products either have natural momentum or they don't. Learn to feel the difference.

**Positive Energy Signals:**
- Users tell others WITHOUT you asking them to
- Organic sharing happens as byproduct of core use case
- Press/attention comes to you, not from your outbound efforts
- Growth compounds: each cohort brings more people than the last
- "10 units of input → growing output" ratio

**Instagram Example:**
"Instagram spread in the early days because people would take photos and then post them on other networks and tell friends about it. There was this really natural 'How did you do that? I want to do it.'"

**Negative Energy Signals:**
- Growth requires constant paid acquisition
- Users don't mention your product to others
- Sharing feels "contrived" when you try to add it
- "10 units of input for one unit of output" ratio
- Metrics barely move despite major feature launches

**Artifact Example:**
"I can't tell you how many people would be like, 'I love Artifact.' I'm like, 'Did you tell anybody about it?' They're like, 'I told one person.' It didn't have that kind of spread."

**Action**: Ask 20 current users: "Have you told anyone about this product? Why or why not?"
- If <30% said yes → lacking viral energy
- If >70% said yes → natural momentum exists

### Step 2: Design for Natural Shareability
Don't force sharing; design core experiences that naturally create "How did you do that?" moments.

**Instagram's Approach:**
- Core value: Beautiful filtered photos
- Natural share behavior: Post to Twitter/Facebook showing the result
- Question from others: "How did you make that photo?"
- Virality emerged from SHOWING output, not asking for shares

**Contrast with Artifact:**
- Core value: Personalized news reading (private)
- No natural artifact to share
- News consumption is personal, not social
- Forcing sharing felt "contrived"

**Design Principles:**
1. **Output-focused sharing**: Let users share their creation/achievement, not your app
2. **Status/identity alignment**: Sharing should enhance user's image
3. **Clear provenance**: Make it obvious "this was made with [Product]"
4. **No forced interstitials**: Don't make sharing painful

**Artifact's Ethical Line**:
"We could wrap all the links in artifact.news but we didn't want interstitial things. There were lines we didn't want to cross that felt ethically not us."

**Action**:
- List 5 ways users could naturally show off what they made/achieved with your product
- For each, ask: "Would they want to share this even if it DIDN'T promote our product?"
- If answer is no, redesign until answer is yes

### Step 3: Understand Your Mobile Web/Distribution Reality
The ecosystem you're building in matters enormously for consumer products.

**Modern Mobile Web Challenges (Artifact's experience):**
- Publishers using aggressive ads and paywalls
- "Sign up for our newsletter" interstitials
- Full-screen video ads disrupting experience
- Click-through experience often worse than the aggregator

**Mike's Reflection**:
"Mobile websites have really taken a turn. I don't blame individuals for this—it's the market dynamics. The app experience I was so proud of, but when you click through it was like [terrible]."

**Ethical Tension**:
- Could implement ad-blocking for better UX
- But "doesn't feel like playing fair with publishers"
- Can't deliver great experience without harming partners

**Action**:
- Map your product's dependency on external platforms/publishers
- Test actual user experience end-to-end (don't assume)
- Identify where you lack control and how it degrades experience
- Evaluate: Can we deliver great experience given these constraints?

### Step 4: Assess "Can We Be Great In-Person?"
Remote/distributed building works for many things, but major product pivots and team changes are much harder.

**Mike's Artifact Reflection**:
"We started mid-COVID, fully distributed. There were major shifts we would've wanted to make in strategy, product, and team. It's really hard to do that if you're all fully remote."

**In-Person Advantages for Consumer Products:**
- Real-time collaboration on UX/design details
- Rapid iteration on feel/polish
- Difficult conversations about pivots or shutdowns
- Team energy and morale during hard times

**Instagram Memory**:
"Me and Kevin at Taqueria Cancun eating burritos at 11 PM being like, 'How are we going to get out of this?' Zoom is not a good replica for that. You tend to let things go or things build up over time."

**Action**:
- If distributed: Schedule in-person sessions for major product decisions
- Don't try to pivot or make major team changes over Zoom
- Build "crisis mode" protocols that involve in-person time
- Evaluate: Is our setup allowing us to make the hard calls when needed?

### Step 5: Know When to Call It
Consumer products either work or they don't. Knowing when to stop is as important as knowing when to push.

**Mike's Decision Framework on Artifact:**

**Question 1: Is there a company to be built here?**
- Yes, news personalization is a real problem
- But: "I'm not sure we're the people to have built it"

**Question 2: What's the input/output ratio?**
- "10 units of input for 1 unit of output"
- Opposite of Instagram (small inputs → large output)
- "If we put blood and tears into the product and launch something we were proud of, metrics would barely move"

**Question 3: What's the opportunity cost?**
- "AI is starting to change everything"
- "Is this the maximal way we're going to impact this?"
- Answer: Increasingly no

**Question 4: What's our honest bar for success?**
- "When we started, we said: what's the bar to success? Do we want it to be Instagram DAU?"
- Knew it wouldn't be Instagram-scale
- But it should feel like "it has its own legs under it and can continue to compound"
- It didn't

**Red Flags to Call It:**
- Metrics flat despite shipping beloved features
- Team needs to convince themselves it's working
- Unclear if another 6-12 months will change trajectory
- Bigger opportunity cost elsewhere

**Action**: If you've been at it 1-2+ years, ask:
1. What's our input/output ratio honestly?
2. Does this have its own legs or are we pushing a boulder uphill?
3. What would we do if we weren't doing this?
4. Can we see a path to this compounding?

**Mike's Peace**:
"In the end, I was really at peace with the decision. It was hard, but it was a conversation that went on for a couple months."

### Step 6: Handle Ego and External Perception
Shutting down after a huge success (Instagram) requires emotional maturity.

**Ego Component**:
"Is it true that you're only as good as your last game? I'm very competitive, but primarily with myself. I'm always trying to find the next hard thing to do."

**External Reception (Artifact Shutdown):**
- Expected "I told you so" reactions
- Actually got: "Kudos for calling it when you saw it"
- Founders reached out: "Saw what you did, realized we were barking up the wrong tree, made the call"

**Mike's Reframe**:
"If that frees up people to go work on more interesting things, I feel like that's a good legacy for Artifact to have."

**Action**:
- Separate product success from self-worth
- Frame shutdown as "data-driven decision" not "failure"
- Share learnings publicly if comfortable (helps others)
- Move toward new challenge quickly (Mike joined Anthropic soon after)

### Step 7: Learn to "Know It When You See It"
Metrics help, but product sense develops from pattern recognition across many products.

**Mike's Philosophy**:
"You know it when you see it in terms of user growth and traction. I wasn't expecting Instagram growth, but I was expecting or hoping for something that felt like it had its own legs under it."

**Calibration Questions**:
- Are users surprised/delighted regularly?
- Do people use it more over time or less?
- Do they bring friends without being asked?
- Do they complain when it's down?
- Would they pay if you asked?

**Action**:
- Study 5-10 successful consumer products in your space
- Identify their "aha moment" and viral loop
- Ask: Do we have equivalents? Are they as strong?
- Be honest: Are we in the same league or fooling ourselves?

## Expected Outcomes
- Clearer sense of whether your product has natural momentum
- Ability to distinguish "this needs iteration" from "this isn't working"
- Better product decisions around sharing and virality
- Confidence to make hard calls (pivot or shutdown) when needed
- Reduced time wasted on products that won't compound

## Common Pitfalls

### Pitfall 1: Forcing Viral Mechanics
**Mistake**: Adding "share to unlock" or forced referral programs to products without natural shareability

**Why It Fails**: Users resent being forced; sharing doesn't feel authentic; doesn't address root issue (product isn't share-worthy)

**Solution**: Fix the core product to create natural "show off" moments first. Only then add light sharing features.

### Pitfall 2: Lowering the Bar Too Much
**Mistake**: "We don't need Instagram-level growth" becomes excuse for mediocre traction

**Reality**: You don't need Instagram scale, but you DO need compounding growth and clear momentum

**Solution**: Set realistic absolute targets ("10K engaged users by month 6") while maintaining high standards for growth rate and retention.

### Pitfall 3: Ignoring the Ecosystem
**Mistake**: Building a beautiful app while ignoring terrible external dependencies (publishers, platforms)

**Solution**: Test the full user journey including parts you don't control. If it's broken, either fix it or reconsider the product.

### Pitfall 4: Staying Too Long "Just in Case"
**Mistake**: "Let's give it 6 more months" when data clearly shows it's not working

**Mike's Counterexample**: Called Artifact after seeing clear patterns, got praised for it

**Solution**: Set decision criteria upfront ("If we don't hit X by Y date, we'll evaluate seriously"). Honor those commitments.

## AI Integration Notes

### Context Signals for This SOP
- User asking about "is my consumer product working"
- Questions about virality, sharing, or growth loops
- Discussions of product-market fit for consumer apps
- User considering shutting down or pivoting a product
- Questions like "how do I know if this is working?"

### Adaptation Guidance
- For B2B products: Many principles DON'T apply (different growth dynamics)
- For early products (<1000 users): Too early for most signals; focus on qualitative love from early users
- For growth-stage products: All signals should be very clear by now
- For enterprise consumer (Slack-like): Hybrid—need both viral AND sales

### Key Quotes to Reference
- "Instagram spread because people would take photos and post them on other networks. It was very natural."
- "10 units of input for 1 unit of output vs. the other way around"
- "You know it when you see it in terms of user growth and traction"
- "The energy is not present in this product, in this system"

### Limitations
- Based primarily on mobile app experience (may differ for web-first products)
- Consumer social products have specific dynamics
- B2B/enterprise products need different frameworks
- Some products (like utilities) don't need virality to succeed
