# Design Feedback Framework

## Metadata
- **Source**: Julie Zhuo - Lenny's Podcast
- **Domain**: Product Management / Design
- **Type**: Framework SOP
- **Applicable To**: Product Managers, Designers, Design Leaders, Engineers
- **Company Stage**: All stages
- **Difficulty**: Beginner to Intermediate

## Overview
Giving effective design feedback is a critical skill for product teams. The key insight: **good feedback focuses on the problem being solved, not the solution presented**. Most feedback fails because it's either too vague ("I don't like it"), too prescriptive ("Make the button blue"), or misses the actual goal.

## When to Use
- Design reviews and critiques
- Product review meetings
- Cross-functional feedback sessions
- Reviewing design work async
- Coaching designers on solutions

## Prerequisites
- Understanding of the user problem being solved
- Context on constraints (time, technical, business)
- Clarity on success metrics
- Separation of roles (PM owns what, designer owns how)

## Core Concept: The Feedback Ladder

### Level 1: Reaction Feedback (Weakest)
**What it sounds like:**
- "I don't like this"
- "This feels off"
- "Something's not working"

**Problem**: No actionable direction. Designer doesn't know what to change.

### Level 2: Solution Feedback (Common but Problematic)
**What it sounds like:**
- "Make the button bigger"
- "Use a carousel here"
- "Add more whitespace"

**Problem**: Prescribes a solution without explaining the underlying issue. May or may not address the real problem.

### Level 3: Problem Feedback (Most Effective)
**What it sounds like:**
- "I'm worried users won't notice the CTA because it doesn't stand out"
- "The information hierarchy isn't clear — I don't know what to focus on first"
- "This flow has too many steps for users who just want to do X"

**Why it works**: Explains the problem, lets the designer find the best solution.

## Procedure

### Step 1: Start with the Goal
Before giving feedback, clarify what you're evaluating against.

**Questions to ask:**
- What user problem is this solving?
- What does success look like?
- What are the constraints?
- What stage is this design at?

**Stage matters:**
| Stage | Appropriate Feedback |
|-------|---------------------|
| Early exploration | Direction, scope, approach |
| Mid-fidelity | Flow, information architecture, key interactions |
| High-fidelity | Visual polish, edge cases, copy |

### Step 2: Separate Observation from Interpretation
Describe what you see, then explain your concern.

**Framework:**
1. **Observation**: "I notice that [specific element]"
2. **Interpretation**: "This makes me think/feel/wonder..."
3. **Question**: "Is that the intended effect?"

**Example:**
- "I notice the pricing is at the bottom of the page (observation). This makes me think users might not see it before making a decision (interpretation). Was that intentional? (question)"

### Step 3: Focus on Users, Not Preferences
Frame feedback in terms of user impact.

**Instead of:**
- "I think the icons are too small"

**Say:**
- "I'm concerned that older users or those on smaller screens might have trouble tapping these icons"

**Key question**: "How will this affect the user?"

### Step 4: Be Specific About the Problem
Vague feedback creates confusion.

**Vague (unhelpful):**
- "This page is too busy"

**Specific (actionable):**
- "There are five different things competing for attention above the fold. I'm not sure what the user should focus on first. The primary action seems to get lost."

### Step 5: Acknowledge Constraints
Recognize what the designer is working with.

**Acknowledge:**
- Technical limitations
- Timeline constraints
- Platform guidelines
- Business requirements

**Example:**
- "I know we're working with the existing component library. Given that constraint, I'm wondering if we could..."

### Step 6: Propose, Don't Prescribe
If you have a solution in mind, offer it as an option.

**Instead of:**
- "Make the header sticky"

**Say:**
- "One option that might help users navigate could be a sticky header, but I'm curious what you think would work best"

### Step 7: Prioritize Your Feedback
Not all feedback is equal. Signal importance.

**Categorize:**
- **Must address**: Blocks the goal from being achieved
- **Should consider**: Would meaningfully improve the outcome
- **Nice to have**: Polish or preference

**Be explicit:**
- "The most important thing is X. Everything else is secondary."

## Giving Feedback in Different Contexts

### In Person / Synchronous
- Start with what's working
- Ask questions before stating concerns
- Watch for designer's reaction
- Collaborate on solutions

### Asynchronous (Comments)
- Be extra clear and specific
- Provide context for each comment
- Categorize by priority
- Offer to discuss live if complex

### In Group Critiques
- Build on others' feedback
- Avoid piling on
- Represent the user perspective
- Stay focused on the goal

## Expected Outcomes
- More productive design reviews
- Faster iteration cycles
- Better designer-PM relationships
- Higher quality design solutions
- Less rework and miscommunication

## Common Pitfalls

### The "I'll know it when I see it" trap
- Failing to articulate what success looks like
- Designers can't hit an undefined target
- Do the upfront work to define goals

### Giving feedback on the wrong stage
- Nitpicking visual details in early exploration
- Questioning strategy in final polish phase
- Match feedback to design maturity

### Making it personal
- "You didn't think about..."
- Feedback is about the work, not the designer
- Use "the design" not "your design" when critiquing

### Death by a thousand cuts
- Endless minor feedback creates thrash
- Prioritize ruthlessly
- Know when "good enough" is good enough

### Solving the designer's job
- PMs should own "what" and "why"
- Designers should own "how"
- Trust designers to find solutions

- Product Review Meeting Structure
- Product Sense Development
- Cross-Functional Collaboration

## AI Integration Notes

### Context signals that should trigger this SOP:
- User asks how to give design feedback
- Design review preparation
- PM-designer collaboration challenges
- Async design feedback requests

### How to apply:
- Emphasize problem-focused feedback
- Guide to appropriate level of feedback
- Help articulate observations vs interpretations
- Encourage prioritization

### Key insight:
The best feedback explains the problem and trusts the designer to find the solution. Your job is to represent the user and the goal — not to design the solution yourself.
