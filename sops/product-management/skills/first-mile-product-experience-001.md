- **Difficulty**: Intermediate

## Overview
The First Mile framework recognizes that in the first 30 seconds of using a new product, users are "lazy, vain, and selfish." They want immediate success, want to look good to others, and won't tolerate learning curves. Most teams spend the final mile of their time building the product considering the first mile of the customer's experience, which is backwards.

## When to Use
- Designing onboarding flows for new products
- Optimizing activation and retention metrics
- Reducing drop-off in the top of funnel
- Redesigning existing product experiences with high abandonment
- Shifting from early adopters to mainstream customers

## Prerequisites
- Clear understanding of your core product value proposition
- Access to funnel metrics showing where users drop off
- Ability to observe actual users experiencing your product

## Procedure

### Step 1: Understand First Mile Psychology
Recognize that users in their first 30 seconds are:
- **Lazy**: Won't read tutorials, watch tours, or endure learning curves
- **Vain**: Want to look competent to colleagues or friends
- **Selfish**: Want immediate personal success and value

### Step 2: Define the First Mile Components
Focus on three critical elements:
- **Onboarding**: The signup and initial setup flow
- **Orientation**: Helping users understand where they are and how they got there
- **Defaults**: The initial state users see (pre-populated, presumptive settings)

### Step 3: Answer Three Critical Questions
Every screen in your first mile must clearly answer:
1. **How did I get here?** (Clear breadcrumbs and context)
2. **What do I do now?** (Obvious next action)
3. **What do I do next?** (Clear path forward)

If users can't instantly answer these questions, redesign that screen.

### Step 4: Optimize for Problems You Want to Have
Only build features that prevent catastrophic failures in the first mile:
- Ensure signup flow works flawlessly
- Enable account connections (Google login, etc.)
- Remove major brick walls

Don't build features for problems you WANT to have:
- Platform availability ("I need this on mobile")
- Advanced capabilities ("Can I share this?")
- Additional integrations

Users will only ask for these after they've gotten value.

### Step 5: Adapt to Customer Cohorts
Recognize that onboarding needs evolve:
- **Early customers**: More forgiving, willing to tolerate friction
- **Later customers**: More skeptical, less patient, need simpler experiences

As your product matures and reaches pragmatist customers, reimagine the onboarding entirely.

### Step 6: Instrument and Observe
- Watch users shoulder-to-shoulder through their first experience
- Measure drop-off at each step of the first mile
- Understand the context in which users are experiencing your product (other apps, meetings, distractions)

### Step 7: Continuously Refine
The first mile is never finished because:
- Customer cohorts change over time
- Expectations evolve as users become more tech-literate
- Product capabilities expand

## Expected Outcomes
- Significantly higher activation rates
- More users reaching the value proposition
- Reduced support tickets related to onboarding
- Higher conversion from signup to active user
- More users getting through the funnel to where they care enough to ask for features

## Common Pitfalls
- **Spending final mile on first mile**: Teams build features first, then rush onboarding at the end. Reverse this - start with the first mile experience.
- **Assuming all users are power users**: Early adopters tolerate complexity; mainstream users don't.
- **Over-explaining**: Tours, tooltips, and tutorials often indicate a poorly designed first mile. Users won't read them.
- **Building features users will ask for later**: Resist adding sharing, platforms, advanced features before users get core value.
- **One-and-done onboarding**: Treating onboarding as a one-time design exercise rather than continuous optimization.
- **Ignoring context**: Not understanding what else users are dealing with when they try your product.

## Object Model Thinking
Create a clear mental model where users always know:
- **Where they came from**: Clear navigation breadcrumbs
- **Where they are**: Clear page/screen orientation
- **Where they're going**: Obvious next steps

If users are confused about any of these, the object model is broken.

## AI Integration Notes
**Context signals that should trigger this SOP:**
- User mentions "onboarding," "activation," "drop-off," "new user experience"
- Discussion of funnel metrics or conversion rates
- Questions about reducing friction in early product experience
- Redesigning for mainstream users after early adopter success

**How to adapt for different situations:**
- **Early stage products**: Focus intensely on first mile before building additional features
- **Mature products**: Audit and continuously optimize as customer base evolves
- **Enterprise products**: First mile includes procurement and admin setup, not just end user
- **Consumer products**: First 30 seconds is literal; users will abandon instantly

**Limitations and edge cases:**
- Some products (professional tools, complex platforms) require learning curves - focus on making early wins within that constraint
- B2B products may have multiple "first miles" (admin, end user, manager)
- Products with network effects may have chicken-and-egg first mile challenges
