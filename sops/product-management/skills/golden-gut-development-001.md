- **Difficulty**: Intermediate to Advanced

## Overview
The "Golden Gut" is the intuitive sense that experienced product thinkers develop for making micro-decisions during product development. It's the ability to ask "I wonder if..." and reduce cognitive load, make presumptive defaults, and simplify experiences in ways that massively improve outcomes. This gut instinct is built through developing deep empathy for customers by being shoulder-to-shoulder with them.

## When to Use
- Building product sense as a PM or designer
- Making design decisions about user flows and interfaces
- Deciding between multiple product options or approaches
- Reducing complexity in product experiences
- Training junior product team members
- Reviewing product designs and identifying improvements

## Prerequisites
- Access to customers or users to observe
- Willingness to spend time in customer context (not just interviews)
- Openness to having assumptions challenged
- Basic understanding of product design principles

## Procedure

### Step 1: Prioritize Empathy Over Solution Passion
Shift your mindset from falling in love with solutions to developing empathy for customer problems.

**The trap**: Teams become passionate about a solution to a problem they're trying to solve

**The better approach**: Do everything you can to develop empathy for the customer suffering the problem

**Why this matters**: Empathy gives you the solution; passion for a solution might be 30 degrees off from what actually works.

### Step 2: Go Shoulder-to-Shoulder With Customers
The most humbling and educational moments come from watching customers in their actual context.

**What to observe:**
- Watch them go about their entire day, not just use your product
- See what else is competing for their attention
- Understand the emotional state they're in when using your product

**Enterprise context:**
- All their other meetings
- Other products they're switching between
- Pings and notifications interrupting them
- Competing priorities and deadlines

**Consumer context:**
- Dealing with kids or loved ones
- Watching Netflix or other entertainment
- Mobile device interruptions
- Physical environment and multitasking

**Why this matters**: Customers use your product amidst everything else. You need context for the data you're seeing.

### Step 3: Develop Pattern Recognition for User Psychology
Understand natural human tendencies in their most primal moments:

**First Mile Psychology (First 30 seconds):**
- Users are LAZY: Won't read, won't watch tours, won't tolerate learning curves
- Users are VAIN: Want to look good to colleagues or friends
- Users are SELFISH: Want to feel successful quickly

**General Psychology Patterns:**
- People talk about products doing what they DIDN'T expect, not what they expected
- Progress is a source of motivation (merchandise it visibly)
- Cognitive load reduction is always valuable
- Defaults matter enormously

### Step 4: Build the "I Wonder If" Muscle
The golden gut expresses itself through constant questioning:

**Examples of golden gut questions:**
- "Wait, what if I just remove this altogether?"
- "What if you didn't even have this whole series of steps?"
- "What if I just had a presumptive default instead and customers could change it if they think they need to?"
- "What if I separated this one page into three steps?"
- "What if I combined these three steps into one page?"

**The pattern**: Experienced product thinkers constantly question assumptions and explore radical simplifications.

### Step 5: Make Micro-Decisions Based on Opportunity Cost
Develop the intuition for tradeoffs:

**Example golden gut decision:**
"Maybe even if 10% of people get confused, getting 90% of people far faster through this process is a big win and a great opportunity cost tradeoff."

**Junior thinking**: "We can't confuse any users, so we need to explain everything"

**Golden gut thinking**: "Confusing 10% is worth 90% having a better experience"

**How to build this**:
- Track the impact of your simplification decisions
- Measure whether removing explanation/steps improves core metrics
- Learn which 10% of confused users actually matter vs. self-select out anyway

### Step 6: Create for Yourself Through Empathy
The best products are made when makers are the customers.

**If you're not the customer:**
1. Develop such deep empathy that you can "feel what they're feeling"
2. This allows you to design "for yourself" (your empathetic self)
3. Your gut reactions become proxies for user reactions

**How to test your empathy:**
- Can you predict what will frustrate users before they tell you?
- Do you feel the cognitive load of your own designs?
- Are you excited or bored by your own product experience?

### Step 7: Practice the Three Questions Framework
On every screen, every flow, every design review, ask:

1. **"How did I get here?"** - Can users understand their breadcrumbs and context?
2. **"What do I do now?"** - Is the core action obvious?
3. **"What do I do next?"** - Is the path forward clear?

If you can't instantly answer all three, your golden gut should be screaming that something's wrong.

This is "object model thinking" - creating clear mental models for how products work.

### Step 8: Expose Yourself to Surface Area
Expand the possibilities you can evaluate:

**How great performers work:**
1. Preserve time to explore LOTS of possibilities
2. Cull those possibilities down to a smaller set
3. Get feedback on that set
4. Refine even further
5. Present the 2-3 best options to the team

**The constraint**: This is a function of TIME. How much time do you have to explore?

**How to expand surface area:**
- Use AI/ChatGPT to generate options you wouldn't have considered
- Study other products solving similar problems
- Look at solutions in adjacent industries
- Ask "what are the things I wouldn't want to do?" (also valuable data)

### Step 9: Bring Design Upstream
Develop golden gut by being involved earlier:

**Traditional**: PMs define problem → Hand to design → Designer creates solutions

**Golden gut development**: Designer in the room during:
- Customer research
- Value proposition debates
- Problem definition discussions
- Strategic planning

**Why**: Hearing these conversations gives designers (and PMs) context that informs their gut instincts later.

### Step 10: Track and Reflect on Your Decisions
Build the muscle through deliberate practice:

**After shipping:**
- Did your gut instinct prove right or wrong?
- What would you do differently knowing the outcome?
- What patterns are emerging in your good vs. bad calls?

**Create a decision journal:**
- What you decided
- What your gut told you
- What the data showed after shipping
- What you learned

## Expected Outcomes
- Faster product decisions with higher quality outcomes
- Ability to reduce cognitive load through thoughtful defaults
- Better instincts for what will confuse vs. delight users
- Confidence to simplify aggressively
- Recognition of difference between junior and senior product thinking
- Improved design reviews and feedback

## Common Pitfalls

### Pitfall 1: Confusing Gut Instinct With Lack of Empathy
**Mistake**: "My gut says users want X" without customer exposure

**Why it fails**: That's not golden gut, that's assumption

**Solution**: Golden gut comes FROM empathy, not instead of it

### Pitfall 2: Only Observing Product Usage, Not Context
**Mistake**: Only watching users interact with your product in usability tests

**Why it fails**: Miss the context of everything else competing for attention

**Solution**: Watch full workflow/day, understand where your product fits

### Pitfall 3: Over-Indexing on Vocal Minority
**Mistake**: Gut reaction driven by loudest feedback

**Why it fails**: Vocal users often aren't representative

**Solution**: Ground gut instinct in broader observation and metrics

### Pitfall 4: Never Testing Your Gut
**Mistake**: Making gut decisions but not tracking if they were right

**Why it fails**: Can't improve if you don't know your hit rate

**Solution**: Journal decisions, review outcomes, identify patterns

### Pitfall 5: Expecting Golden Gut Without Time Investment
**Mistake**: Wanting senior product instincts without shoulder-to-shoulder time

**Why it fails**: Pattern recognition requires pattern exposure

**Solution**: There's no shortcut; invest the time with customers

## Difference: Junior vs. Senior Product Thinker

### Junior Product Thinker
- Accepts complexity as necessary
- Explains features to reduce confusion
- Tries to serve all users equally
- Focuses on features as solutions
- Designs in isolation from customer context

### Golden Gut Product Thinker
- Questions whether complexity is necessary at all
- Removes features to reduce confusion
- Makes tradeoffs favoring majority experience
- Focuses on psychology and human tendencies
- Designs with deep customer context

**The gap**: The "I wonder if" moments that question fundamental assumptions

## Real-World Examples from Scott

### Example 1: Behance Portfolio Color Controls
**Context**: Users could customize portfolio colors with brand elements

**Junior thinking**: "Users love customization, this adds value"

**Golden gut question**: "What would happen if we just took this away? Would people focus more on projects?"

**Outcome**:
- Removed the feature
- 24 hours of complaints
- Then silence
- Portfolios looked cleaner and more consistent
- Core metric (projects published) went UP

**Lesson**: Sometimes removing options increases core value

### Example 2: Three Questions Test
**Every screen must answer:**
1. How did I get here?
2. What do I do now?
3. What do I do next?

**When teams say they're "design-driven"** but can't answer these three questions on every screen:

**Golden gut reaction**: "This is all over the place. There's no clean clear breadcrumbs and object model for how this thing works. How are they ever going to get people through their funnel?"

**Red flag**: Team doesn't value this as core principle

## AI Integration Notes

**Context signals that should trigger this SOP:**
- User asks how to build product sense or intuition
- Questions about making better product decisions
- Discussion of understanding user psychology
- Mentions of wanting to think like senior product person
- Reviewing product designs and providing feedback
- Onboarding junior PMs or designers

**How to adapt for different situations:**
- **New PMs**: Emphasize shoulder-to-shoulder time as non-negotiable foundation
- **Experienced PMs**: Focus on expanding surface area and questioning assumptions even more
- **Designers**: Bring them into upstream conversations to build context
- **Founders**: You likely have empathy for problem; apply golden gut to simplification
- **Enterprise products**: Context observation even more critical due to complex workflows

**Limitations and edge cases:**
- Some products serve such diverse users that single golden gut doesn't work (need segment-specific guts)
- Highly technical products may require domain expertise beyond empathy
- Platform products may have conflicting gut instincts for different user types
- New paradigms (VR, AI) may not have established patterns yet

**When suggesting this SOP:**
- Encourage actual customer observation, not just interviews
- Help user articulate "I wonder if" questions in their context
- Remind that golden gut develops over time, not overnight
- Suggest tracking decisions to accelerate learning
- Connect empathy work to better product outcomes
