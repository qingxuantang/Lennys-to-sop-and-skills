## Overview
High agency is the ability to find a way to get what you want without waiting for conditions to be perfect or blaming circumstances. The key insight: **high agency is what differentiates PMs who have outsized impact from those who have the same potential but don't achieve it**.

## When to Use
- Career development
- Evaluating PM candidates
- Coaching underperforming PMs
- Self-assessment
- Building team culture
- Breaking through obstacles

## Prerequisites
- Willingness to take ownership
- Comfort with ambiguity
- Resilience to setbacks
- Growth mindset

## Core Concept: The Three Components

### 1. Ownership Mindset
**Definition**: Taking full responsibility for outcomes, not just activities.

**Low agency:** "I did my part. Engineering didn't deliver."
**High agency:** "The project didn't ship. What could I have done differently?"

**Characteristics:**
- Accountable for outcomes, not just tasks
- Doesn't wait for permission
- Fills gaps even outside "their job"
- Takes on problems others avoid

### 2. Creative Execution
**Definition**: Finding novel paths when the obvious path is blocked.

**Low agency:** "We can't do that because [constraint]."
**High agency:** "Given [constraint], here's how we could still achieve this..."

**Characteristics:**
- Sees constraints as puzzles, not walls
- Generates multiple options
- Finds unconventional solutions
- Doesn't accept "impossible" easily

### 3. Resilience
**Definition**: Persisting through setbacks and adversity.

**Low agency:** "We tried that and it didn't work."
**High agency:** "That approach didn't work. Here's what we learned and what we're trying next."

**Characteristics:**
- Bounces back from failure
- Learns from setbacks
- Maintains energy through adversity
- Doesn't give up easily

## Procedure

### Step 1: Assess Your Current Agency Level
Honest self-evaluation first.

**Ownership assessment:**
| Question | Low Agency Answer | High Agency Answer |
|----------|-------------------|---------------------|
| "Why didn't this ship?" | "X team blocked us" | "I should have engaged X earlier" |
| "Whose job is this?" | "Not mine" | "It needs doing, I'll figure it out" |
| "Who's responsible?" | "The team" (vague) | "I am" (specific) |

**Creative execution assessment:**
| Question | Low Agency Answer | High Agency Answer |
|----------|-------------------|---------------------|
| "Can we do this?" | "No, because..." | "Maybe, if we..." |
| "What about constraints?" | Lists constraints | Lists workarounds |
| "What options do we have?" | "The obvious one" | "Here are five options" |

**Resilience assessment:**
| Question | Low Agency Answer | High Agency Answer |
|----------|-------------------|---------------------|
| "That failed, now what?" | "Move on to something else" | "Try a different approach" |
| "How's your energy?" | Varies with circumstances | Stable despite setbacks |
| "After rejection?" | Avoid similar situations | Adjust and try again |

### Step 2: Develop Ownership Mindset
Practice taking responsibility.

**Exercises:**
1. **The 100% rule**: Ask "What could I have done to change this outcome?" for every failure, even if you feel 0% responsible.

2. **Gap filling**: Identify one thing that's "not your job" but needs doing. Do it without being asked.

3. **Outcome framing**: Reframe every task from activity ("write PRD") to outcome ("ensure team is aligned on what to build").

**Daily practice:**
- When something goes wrong, start with "What's my part in this?"
- When there's a gap, ask "What can I do?" before "Who should do this?"
- When delegating, stay accountable for the outcome

### Step 3: Develop Creative Execution
Practice finding alternative paths.

**Exercises:**
1. **The constraint flip**: When facing a constraint, ask "How could this constraint actually help us?"

2. **Five options rule**: Never bring one option. Generate at least three, preferably five approaches to any problem.

3. **Impossibility audit**: Take something "impossible" and spend 30 minutes finding paths to possible.

**Question reframes:**
| Instead of | Ask |
|------------|-----|
| "Why can't we?" | "What would it take to?" |
| "That's not possible" | "What would make it possible?" |
| "They won't let us" | "How do we get them to yes?" |

**Pattern recognition:**
- Study how others overcame similar constraints
- Build a library of "unconventional solutions"
- Notice what's assumed vs. what's truly fixed

### Step 4: Develop Resilience
Build the capacity to persist.

**Exercises:**
1. **Failure reframe**: For every failure, document what you learned and what you'll try next.

2. **Energy audit**: Track what depletes and restores your energy. Manage proactively.

3. **Small wins**: After a setback, accomplish something small to rebuild momentum.

**Resilience practices:**
- Separate identity from outcomes (failure ≠ you're a failure)
- Build support network for tough times
- Celebrate the attempt, not just the result
- Keep a "wins journal" to reference during setbacks

**Perspective techniques:**
- "This too shall pass" (setbacks are temporary)
- "What will I think of this in 5 years?" (zoom out)
- "What can I learn here?" (extract value from failure)

### Step 5: Apply to Specific Situations
Use high agency in common PM challenges.

**When stakeholders say no:**
- Low agency: Accept no, move on
- High agency: Understand why, find alternative that addresses concerns

**When resources are constrained:**
- Low agency: "We can't do this without X"
- High agency: "Here's how we could do a version with what we have"

**When timeline is tight:**
- Low agency: "We'll have to cut scope"
- High agency: "What's the minimum that achieves the outcome? What creative approaches could speed us up?"

**When facing organizational resistance:**
- Low agency: "The organization won't let us"
- High agency: "Who can I influence? What evidence would change minds?"

### Step 6: Create High Agency Culture
Spread agency to your team.

**Model the behavior:**
- Be visibly high agency
- Talk through your reasoning
- Show how you overcome obstacles

**Coach for agency:**
- When team members bring problems, ask "What options do you see?"
- Celebrate creative solutions
- Normalize failure as learning

**Structure for agency:**
- Give outcomes, not just tasks
- Provide autonomy with accountability
- Remove permission-seeking where possible

## Expected Outcomes
- Outsized impact relative to potential
- Faster problem resolution
- Better reputation with leadership
- More career opportunities
- Increased team effectiveness

## Common Pitfalls

### Confusing high agency with overwork
- High agency is about effectiveness, not hours
- Work smarter, not just harder
- Creative execution can save effort

### Taking on too much (heroism)
- High agency ≠ doing everything yourself
- Knowing when to escalate is high agency
- Building systems is higher agency than individual heroics

### Ignoring legitimate constraints
- High agency isn't delusion
- Some constraints are real
- Wise to know the difference

### Not asking for help
- High agency includes leveraging resources
- "How can I get help?" is a valid creative question
- Independence isn't the goal; outcomes are

### Burning out
- Resilience requires recovery
- Unsustainable effort isn't high agency
- Pace yourself for the long run

## AI Integration Notes

### Context signals that should trigger this SOP:
- PM feeling stuck
- "I can't because..."
- Victim mindset language
- Potential not matching output

### How to apply:
- Help reframe constraints as puzzles
- Suggest ownership questions
- Generate creative options
- Coach on resilience techniques

### Key insight:
High agency explains why some PMs with moderate experience outperform those with impressive credentials. It's about taking ownership, finding creative paths, and persisting through obstacles — all learnable skills.
