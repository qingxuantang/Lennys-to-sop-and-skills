- **Difficulty**: Intermediate to Advanced

## Overview
A comprehensive framework for accelerating PM career growth based on Brandon Chu's journey from PM to VP at Shopify during hypergrowth (500 to 12,000 people). This SOP focuses on developing founder-level skills, building domain expertise, and leveraging high-growth environments for maximum learning velocity.

## When to Use
- When planning your PM career trajectory
- When choosing between job opportunities or projects
- When trying to move from entry-level to senior PM roles
- When developing skills beyond basic PM competencies
- When considering what to focus on for maximum career impact
- When evaluating learning opportunities

## Prerequisites
- Entry-level PM skills (analytical, organizational, communication)
- Basic technical literacy
- Willingness to take on side projects or additional work
- Growth mindset and comfort with ambiguity
- Self-awareness about your current skill gaps

## Procedure

### Step 1: Recognize the Baseline and Growth Path

**Table Stakes: Entry-Level PM Skills**
These are necessary but not sufficient for rapid career growth:
- Organizational skills
- Analytical abilities
- Good communication
- Technical skills (basic)
- Process management
- Stakeholder coordination

Brandon's insight: "There's sort of table stakes and commodities to be an entry level PM. And to be clear, it's not easy to be a PM. It's not an entry level job. And so that is no knock on that."

**Growth Multipliers: What Actually Accelerates Careers**
- Domain expertise (takes you "a little bit further")
- Founder skills (creates "highest trajectory" and "tailwind")
- Learning velocity (rapid role transitions enable contrast)
- High-growth environment experience
- Written communication and influence

**The Founder Skills Differentiator**
"I think ultimately to have the highest trajectory and what certainly was a tailwind for my career was you guys have to lean into those founder skills."

### Step 2: Develop Founder-Level Skills

**Core Founder Skills for PMs**

**Skill 1: Storytelling**
- Not just presenting—compelling narrative creation
- Connecting vision to execution
- Inspiring teams and stakeholders
- Communicating "why" as powerfully as "what"

**Skill 2: Getting the Most Out of People**
- Understanding individual motivations
- Unlocking team potential
- Creating psychological safety
- Recognizing and leveraging strengths

**Skill 3: Fostering Creative and Motivated Teams**
- Building culture beyond just managing work
- Encouraging innovation and risk-taking
- Maintaining energy and momentum
- Celebrating wins and learning from failures

**Skill 4: High-Conviction Decision Making**
- Making calls when there's no clear data
- Taking leaps of faith with team buy-in
- "Really, really hard high conviction decisions that actually can't be solved"
- Bringing teams through ambiguity

**Skill 5: Leading by Example with Accountability**
- Owning outcomes completely
- Demonstrating behaviors you expect
- Taking responsibility for failures
- Following through on commitments
- "How to lead by example and have accountability when you make those choices"

**Why These Skills Matter**
"These really became the things that were limiters for some careers I observed and then were definitely propelling for a lot of the people that made it to high level of leadership."

### Step 3: Build Domain Expertise Strategically

**What Domain Expertise Means**
- Deep knowledge in a specific product area
- Examples: Payments, 3D modeling, developer platforms, growth, AI/ML
- "Amazing payments PM or you have some really nuanced knowledge"

**How to Build It**
1. Choose a domain aligned with market growth
2. Stay in domain long enough to go deep (2-4 years)
3. Learn adjacent skills within the domain
4. Become the go-to expert internally
5. Contribute to domain knowledge externally (writing, speaking)

**Platform PM as High-Leverage Domain**
Brandon specialized in "platform management and developer ecosystems"
- High technical depth required
- Unique multi-stakeholder challenges
- Long-term strategic thinking
- Valuable across many companies (every platform needs these skills)

**Strategic Domain Selection**
Choose domains that:
- Are growing in market importance (AI, platforms, etc.)
- Require specialized knowledge
- Have transferable skills across companies
- Align with your interests and strengths
- Have limited expert supply

### Step 4: Create Side Hustle Learning Experiences

**The Side Hustle Imperative**
"Look, it is hard to do when you are a PM somewhere, but do a legitimate side hustle, found a company on the side and learn everything else."

**Why Side Hustles Matter**
- Break out of PM feature silo
- Learn what it means to sell to a customer
- Understand product support challenges
- Experience shipping something that breaks
- Gain empathy for founders (especially relevant at Shopify)
- "Reminds you of how hard it is to build software and how many people it takes to do that well"

**What to Build**
- Doesn't need to be successful commercially
- Should require multiple disciplines (build, market, support)
- Technical enough to break through tech barriers
- Real enough to have actual users

**Breaking Technical Barriers**
"Literally don't even know what HTML is or something like that... from right now over the weekend, you could build a clone of Twitter using a tutorial on Rails"

**Outcomes from Side Projects**
1. Demystify technology
2. Understand full product lifecycle
3. Gain founder empathy
4. Build confidence in technical discussions
5. Create portfolio/proof of capability
6. "Once people break through that wall, when they're nontechnical, I think the momentum builds from there"

### Step 5: Maximize Learning Velocity Through Contrast

**The Power of Rapid Transitions**
Brandon's advantage: "I had a really good career trajectory at the same time so I could actually observe. I wasn't too mired in being a PM one for five years and then moving. I was moving through things really quickly."

**Creating Contrast**
- "I was able to contrast things because it was literally like, 'Oh wait, three months ago, it was that. Now, how do I change?'"
- Rapid role changes surface new mental models
- Different scopes reveal different challenges
- Moving fast prevents stagnation in thinking

**How to Create Contrast Opportunities**
1. Take on stretch projects outside core role
2. Volunteer for new initiatives
3. Change teams/products every 18-24 months
4. Seek companies in hypergrowth
5. Move between platform and product work
6. Switch domains periodically

**Hypergrowth as Accelerant**
"It's also at Shopify I grew so much during that time. Right? We grew seven years ago. I came at just under 500 people. Were over 12,000 people today."

Benefits of hypergrowth environments:
- Constant new challenges
- Role evolves rapidly
- Leadership gaps open up
- Forced learning and adaptation
- Exposure to scaling problems

### Step 6: Develop Strategic Influence Skills

**Job Description: The Shopify Definition**
"Your job is to help teams ship the right thing at the right time in the right way."

**Key Concepts**

**"Help Teams" - Servant Leadership**
- Not "CEO of the product"
- Not dictator
- Facilitator and enabler
- "Everyone's responsible for product thinking and you're there to help the team get to ultimately the right thing"

**"The Right Thing" - Strategic Accountability**
- You own the outcome
- "That is what you are accountable for"
- At senior levels: "It becomes a pure strategic function"
- "My ass is online for us going there"

**Evolution by Level**

**IC/Junior PM**
- "Much bigger emphasis on balanced decision making between all the crafts"
- User experience, engineering, and PM have equal say
- Focus on collaboration and consensus

**Director and Above**
- "More emphasis put on where the PM wants to lead"
- Strategic function
- "Your only job is to say, 'We need to go there and my ass is online for us going there'"
- Make the choice, own it completely

**Managing the Transition**
"There was obviously lots of tension as we grew of, 'Hey. We used to collaborate, but now you're saying we have to do this thing.' And it's like, well, actually, the company, the context changed, my role changed and we have to do something and it has to be someone's job to make that choice."

### Step 7: Choose Your Environment Strategically

**What Made Shopify Special for Brandon's Growth**

**Strong Product Culture**
- Highly technical company (everyone touched GitHub)
- Product thinking valued across all functions
- "Everyone at the company from engineers to support, to sales, everyone's responsible for product thinking"

**Founder-Oriented Culture**
- 30-40% of PMs are ex-founders
- Values "versatility and grit and growth mindset"
- Building for entrepreneurs creates empathy alignment
- "We have a lot of empathy for our customers through that"

**Canadian Roots = Ambition Culture**
- "There has been a lot of failed tech companies in Canada and no company that's ever truly been global"
- Creates hunger and founder mentality
- No complacency despite success

**Rapid Growth Phase**
- 500 to 12,000+ people in 7 years
- Constant new challenges and opportunities
- Leadership gaps to fill
- Learning through scaling pain

**Key Environment Factors**
When choosing where to work, prioritize:
1. Strong product culture and craft
2. Hypergrowth phase (50-5000 people ideal)
3. Ambitious mission and team
4. Technical depth and excellence
5. Opportunity for rapid role evolution
6. Leadership that values product thinking

### Step 8: Build Your Influence Through Writing

**The Career Accelerator**
"It has had an incredible, incredible impact on my personal career... it accelerated my career probably a decade."

**Multiple Compounding Effects**
1. Internal influence at scale
2. Faster team onboarding
3. Talent attraction
4. Leadership credibility
5. External network building
6. Thought leadership positioning

See related SOP: "Building Product Influence Through Writing" for complete framework.

### Step 9: Embrace Flexibility and Anti-Sunk Cost Thinking

**The Shopify Approach**
"We're pretty good at never falling into sunk-cost fallacy. So we'll throw it all away anytime if the world changes."

**Career Application**
- Don't stay in roles purely because you've invested time
- Pivot when learning curve flattens
- Recognize when context has changed
- "Always have to ask ourselves this is the most important thing that we can do right now"

**COVID Example**
Shopify threw away entire 2020 roadmap to focus on merchant survival
- Shifted 500 people to 3 critical features
- Demonstrated organizational agility
- Created new opportunities for impact

**Personal Flexibility**
- Started in platform domain, built expertise
- "In classic Shopify form, I completely threw it all away and started something a little different inside the company 18 months ago"
- Now leads "product acceleration" (investments)
- Willingness to reinvent yourself

## Expected Outcomes

**Short-Term (0-2 years)**
- Solid entry-level PM skills mastered
- Initial domain expertise developing
- Side project launched or in progress
- Technical barriers breaking down
- Writing practice beginning

**Medium-Term (2-5 years)**
- Deep domain expertise in one area
- Founder skills developing through practice
- Published writing creating influence
- Senior PM or Director level reached
- Strong internal network and credibility

**Long-Term (5-10 years)**
- VP or executive-level role
- Multiple domains of expertise
- Industry recognition and network
- Proven track record of high-conviction decisions
- Ability to lead through ambiguity at scale

## Common Pitfalls

**Pitfall 1: Over-Indexing on Hard Skills**
- **Symptom**: Great at analysis, weak at influence and leadership
- **Fix**: Deliberately develop founder skills (storytelling, conviction, accountability)
- **Remember**: Hard skills are "table stakes," founder skills create trajectory

**Pitfall 2: Domain Jumping Too Frequently**
- **Symptom**: Broad but shallow expertise, not seen as domain expert
- **Fix**: Commit to 2-4 years in one domain before switching
- **Remember**: Domain expertise "takes you a little bit further"

**Pitfall 3: Staying in PM Silo**
- **Symptom**: Don't understand sales, support, marketing, or engineering deeply
- **Fix**: Launch a side hustle to experience full business
- **Remember**: "Reminds you of how hard it is to build software"

**Pitfall 4: Avoiding Technical Depth**
- **Symptom**: Can't engage in technical discussions, lose credibility
- **Fix**: Build something yourself, break through the technical barrier
- **Remember**: "You could build a clone of Twitter using a tutorial on Rails"

**Pitfall 5: Choosing Stable Over Growth**
- **Symptom**: Slow career progression, limited learning
- **Fix**: Seek hypergrowth environments even if less comfortable
- **Remember**: Brandon grew from PM to VP during 500→12,000 person phase

**Pitfall 6: Not Documenting Your Learning**
- **Symptom**: Learning doesn't compound, influence limited to immediate team
- **Fix**: Write about what you're learning in real-time
- **Remember**: "It accelerated my career probably a decade"

**Pitfall 7: Consensus Over Conviction**
- **Symptom**: Can't make hard calls, wait for perfect data
- **Fix**: Practice high-conviction decisions on smaller bets first
- **Remember**: At senior levels, "your only job is to say, 'We need to go there'"

**Pitfall 8: Ignoring Leadership Transitions**
- **Symptom**: Trying to operate same way as IC when you're now a director
- **Fix**: Recognize when your role requires strategic conviction over collaboration
- **Remember**: "The company, the context changed, my role changed"

## Real-World Application

### Brandon's Journey Milestones

**Years 0-4: Foundation Building**
- Finance background → bootstrapped startup (Tunezy)
- Learned product by doing (non-technical co-founder)
- FreshBooks (4 years): "Hardened PM skills" with structured processes
- Built technical skills (front-end development)

**Years 4-7: Domain Expertise**
- Joined Shopify at IPO (500 people)
- Focused on platform and developer ecosystems
- Wrote influential posts during this phase
- PM → Director → VP trajectory

**Years 7-11: Reinvention**
- Threw away platform expertise
- Started "product acceleration" (investments)
- Maintained flexibility despite seniority
- Continued learning through change

### Key Acceleration Factors
1. Side hustle (Tunezy) before first real PM role
2. Hypergrowth environment (Shopify 500→12,000)
3. Domain focus (platform/developer ecosystems)
4. Writing for influence (6-8 major posts)
5. Rapid role transitions enabling contrast
6. Founder skill development
7. High-conviction decision making practice

## Measuring Progress

### IC PM to Senior PM
- Can you make decisions without perfect data?
- Do team members come to you for product guidance?
- Have you developed unique domain expertise?
- Can you influence beyond your immediate team?

### Senior PM to Director
- Can you set strategy for multiple teams?
- Do you write compelling vision documents?
- Can you hire and develop other PMs?
- Do you make high-conviction calls that stick?

### Director to VP
- Can you lead through major organizational change?
- Do you influence company-level strategy?
- Can you build and lead entire product organizations?
- Are you recognized internally and externally as a leader?

## AI Integration Notes

**Context Signals for AI**
Recommend this SOP when user mentions:
- "How do I advance my PM career?"
- "Stuck at [level], how to get to [next level]?"
- "What skills should I develop as a PM?"
- "Should I specialize or generalize?"
- "IC vs. manager track for PMs"
- "How to stand out as a PM?"

**Adaptation Guidance**
- For entry-level PMs: Focus on table stakes mastery + one founder skill
- For senior PMs: Emphasize high-conviction decision making and domain depth
- For directors: Strategic thinking and organizational influence
- For those considering PM: Side hustle path as entry point

**Different Contexts**
- Startups: Founder skills matter most, domain expertise less critical early
- Growth stage: Domain expertise + rapid learning = high leverage
- Large companies: Writing and influence skills become more important
- Platform companies: Technical depth and multi-stakeholder skills premium

**Limitations**
- Requires access to hypergrowth environment (or create your own via side hustle)
- Writing requires significant time investment
- Founder skills take years to develop
- Not everyone wants to reach VP level (optimize for your own goals)
- Some skills (conviction, accountability) require actual decision-making authority
