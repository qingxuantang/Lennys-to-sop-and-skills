## Overview
The PM Competencies Framework defines 12 competencies across four areas that are essential for product managers at every level. The key insight: **these competencies are the same for APMs as for CPOs — only the scope changes, not the competencies themselves**.

## When to Use
- Self-assessment and development
- Performance reviews
- Career planning
- Hiring and interview design
- PM leveling and ladders
- Coaching and mentoring

## Prerequisites
- Honest self-reflection
- Manager or peer feedback
- Understanding of role expectations

## Core Concept: 12 Competencies in 4 Areas

## Procedure

### Step 1: Self-Assessment
Rate yourself on each competency.

**Rating scale:**
- **Needs Focus**: Significant development needed
- **On Track**: Meeting expectations
- **Outperforming**: Exceeding expectations

**Assessment template:**
| Competency | Self Rating | Evidence |
|------------|-------------|----------|
| Functional Specification | | |
| Product Delivery | | |
| Product Quality | | |
| Fluency with Data | | |
| Voice of the Customer | | |
| User Experience Design | | |
| Business Outcome Ownership | | |
| Product Vision & Roadmapping | | |
| Strategic Impact | | |
| Stakeholder Inclusion | | |
| Team Leadership | | |
| Managing Up | | |

### Step 2: Get External Assessment
Ask your manager to rate you.

**Process:**
1. Share the framework with your manager
2. Ask them to rate each competency
3. Compare ratings
4. Discuss differences

**Key insight:**
> "The areas where your manager and you see eye to eye and the areas where you see differently is stimulus for a really deep conversation."

### Step 3: Identify Patterns
Look for clusters and archetypes.

**Common PM archetypes:**
| Archetype | Strong Areas | Growth Areas |
|-----------|--------------|--------------|
| Growth PM | Data, Outcomes | UX, Vision |
| Product Discovery | Customer, UX | Data, Delivery |
| Technical PM | Delivery, Quality | Strategy, Stakeholders |
| Strategic PM | Vision, Strategy | Execution, Data |

**Questions to ask:**
- What pattern do I see?
- Is this the archetype I want?
- What gaps should I close?

### Step 4: Create Development Plan
Prioritize areas for growth.

**Prioritization criteria:**
- Role requirements (what's expected now)
- Career goals (where I want to go)
- Biggest gaps (highest leverage improvement)

**Development plan template:**
| Competency | Current | Target | Actions | Timeline |
|------------|---------|--------|---------|----------|
| [Gap 1] | Needs Focus | On Track | [Specific actions] | Q1 |
| [Gap 2] | On Track | Outperforming | [Specific actions] | Q2 |

### Step 5: Use for Exponential Feedback
Make feedback compound over time.

**The problem with typical feedback:**
- Surface level
- Focuses on symptoms
- One-time correction
- No compounding

**Exponential feedback:**
- Root cause focused
- Tied to competencies
- Builds self-diagnosis
- Compounds over time

**Framework for giving feedback:**
1. Identify the symptom (what happened)
2. Map to competency (underlying skill)
3. Discuss pattern (not just instance)
4. Create development action

### Step 6: Apply to Hiring
Use competencies for interviews.

**Interview mapping:**
| Competency | Interview Format |
|------------|-----------------|
| Functional Specification | Spec writing exercise |
| Product Delivery | Past experience questions |
| Data Fluency | Analytics case study |
| Voice of Customer | User research discussion |
| UX Design | Design critique |
| Business Outcomes | Product sense questions |
| Strategy | Strategy case |
| Stakeholder Management | Past conflict resolution |

**Go-to interview question:**
> "Tell me about a product that you love."
>
> Follow-ups: Why do you love it? Why do others love it? What would you improve? How would you measure that improvement?

## Expected Outcomes
- Clear development priorities
- Better self-awareness
- More effective feedback
- Stronger hiring decisions
- Career growth acceleration

## Common Pitfalls

### Treating all competencies equally
- Different roles need different strengths
- Growth PM ≠ Platform PM
- Prioritize based on context

### Only focusing on weaknesses
- Strengths matter too
- Sometimes lean into strengths
- Build T-shaped skills

### Skipping external perspective
- Self-assessment is biased
- Manager assessment adds calibration
- Gap analysis drives conversation

### Ignoring competency changes by level
- Same 12 competencies
- But scope changes dramatically
- APM: Individual features
- CPO: Systems and organization

- Performance Review Framework
- PM Interview Guide

## AI Integration Notes

### Context signals that should trigger this SOP:
- "How do I grow as a PM?"
- Career development questions
- Performance review preparation
- PM hiring/interviewing

### How to apply:
- Start with self-assessment
- Compare to manager assessment
- Identify patterns and gaps
- Create development plan

### Key insight:
The 12 competencies are universal across PM levels — only the scope changes. An APM writes specs for features; a CPO creates systems that ensure spec quality across the organization.
