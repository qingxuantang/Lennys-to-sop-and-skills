- **Domain**: Product Management - Quality & Culture
- **Type**: Process + Framework
- **Applicable To**: Product Teams, Engineering, Design, All-Hands Culture Building
- **Difficulty**: Beginner to Intermediate

## Overview
High product quality comes from the entire company using the product extensively and feeling personally accountable for its quality. This SOP teaches how to strategically increase internal product usage beyond obvious use cases, creating a culture where everyone is motivated to fix problems they encounter firsthand.

## When to Use
- When product quality is inconsistent or declining
- When building a new product or feature that needs quality validation
- When teams lack personal connection to customer problems
- When bugs and issues aren't being prioritized
- When trying to build product-driven company culture
- When scaling teams and need to maintain quality standards

## Prerequisites
- Product that can potentially be used internally
- Willingness to adapt workflows to use your own product
- Leadership buy-in for cultural changes
- Ability to make internal process changes

## Procedure

### Step 1: Create Universal Usage Opportunities
**Purpose**: Get beyond obvious dogfooding to pervasive usage

**Identify creative internal use cases:**

**At Figma:**
- Designers use Figma 6+ hours/day (obvious use case)
- **Created**: Switched from memo culture to deck culture → everyone builds presentations in Figma
- **Created**: Performance review calibrations run in FigJam (Head of Design created template, HR distributed it)
- **Created**: Interview debriefs conducted in FigJam
- **Created**: Product reviews held in FigJam
- **Created**: Internal docs and wikis built in Figma/FigJam

**The principle**: Get creative about enabling your entire company to use the product, not just the team that obviously needs it.

**Exercise for your product:**
1. List all internal workflows and processes
2. For each, ask: "Could we do this in our product?"
3. Prioritize high-frequency activities (weekly/daily)
4. Create templates or guidance to make adoption easy
5. Have leadership model the behavior

### Step 2: Engineer Personal Accountability
**Purpose**: Connect emotional investment to product quality

**The core insight from Uber:**
- Engineers who took Ubers to work saw driver problems firsthand
- When they saw a driver struggling, they felt embarrassed
- This personal embarrassment drove them to fix issues immediately
- The motivation was completely different than just being assigned a bug

**How to create personal accountability:**

**For internal users:**
- Everyone uses the product in their actual work
- When something breaks, it's their own workflow that suffers
- They can't ignore problems they experience daily
- Satisfaction from fixing your own pain is deeply motivating

**For external users:**
- Create human connections between builders and users
- At Figma: Designers know their users personally from Twitter/community
- They feel accountable because users are people they know
- Must ship something they're proud to defend

**Action items:**
1. Map which team members interact with which customers
2. Create more human connection points (user interviews, support rotation, community engagement)
3. Celebrate when engineers/designers ship something they personally needed
4. Share stories of team members encountering their own bugs

### Step 3: Empower Bottom-Up Quality Fixes
**Purpose**: Let passion and firsthand pain drive improvements

**The scenario:**
- Engineer takes an Uber, sees driver struggling with app
- Comes back to desk, sees the bug report
- Wants to fix it immediately

**The tension:**
- PM says: "We have goals, roadmap, priorities—no time for this random bug"
- Engineer says: "This is embarrassing, I need to fix it"

**The right approach (from Figma):**
> "One of the most powerful things, especially for startups, is that bottoms-up energy... If people are doing that constantly, and everyone in the company is trying to make the product better, that is sometimes a way more effective way to improve the quality of experience than this top-down of, 'let's define this quality experience metric and try to change all the things,' because you might miss these things."

**Key insight on motivation:**
> "If you ask an engineer about how much time it'll cost to go and build something, and it's something that they came up with or they're advocating for, it's almost always half the time as something that you are asking for, as a PM. And that motivation is so different."

**Implementation:**
1. **Create space for quality fixes**: Reserve 10-20% of sprint capacity for team-initiated improvements
2. **Trust engineer time estimates**: When engineers want to fix their own pain, get out of the way
3. **Celebrate dogfooding wins**: Share stories when internal usage drives quality improvements
4. **Lightweight approval process**: Make it easy to take on quality work without heavy process
5. **Balance, don't block**: Yes, have priorities, but don't kill all bottom-up energy

### Step 4: Design for Internal-First Testing
**Purpose**: Catch issues before customers do

**Figma's approach:**
- Strong culture of internal testing and dogfooding
- All new features used internally first
- Quality bar maintained through actual usage

**The scaling challenge:**
> "As we're getting bigger, one of the things that I'm realizing is that we're starting to build a lot of features that are not, necessarily, for organizations like ours. And when we do that, we really need to be creative about how we understand how effective those are."

**Adaptation strategies when you're not the target user:**

1. **Recruit internal proxies**: Find team members closest to target customer
2. **Intense external beta**: Replace internal dogfooding with close customer partnerships
3. **Embedded researchers**: Have researchers deeply involved in usage testing
4. **Frequent customer immersion**: Product team must spend more time with target users
5. **Advisory boards**: Create customer council for regular feedback

**Process:**
- Internal alpha → Internal beta → External beta → Launch
- Each stage requires actual usage, not just review
- Metrics on internal adoption before external release

### Step 5: Build Cultural Rituals Around Quality
**Purpose**: Make product quality a shared value, not just PM responsibility

**Examples:**

**At Figma:**
- Leadership uses the product (Dylan Field, CEO, reads most customer feedback of anyone)
- Cross-functional calibrations happen in FigJam (makes it essential)
- Design team vocally advocates for quality (setting the standard)

**At Uber:**
- Everyone takes Ubers
- Driver and rider experiences are part of company life
- Stories shared about experiences

**Create your rituals:**

1. **Weekly quality showcase**: Team shares quality improvements they shipped
2. **CEO/Founder dogfooding**: Leadership visibly uses and gives feedback
3. **Internal launch celebrations**: Celebrate when new features enable internal workflows
4. **Quality heroes**: Recognize people who went above and beyond on quality
5. **Bug bash rituals**: Regular company-wide testing sessions

### Step 6: Measure Internal Engagement as Leading Indicator
**Purpose**: Use internal adoption as quality signal

**Metrics to track:**
- % of employees actively using product weekly
- Hours per week average usage
- Internal NPS or satisfaction
- Ratio of internally-discovered bugs to customer-discovered bugs
- Time from internal discovery to fix

**Green flags:**
- High internal usage
- Internal users advocating for product
- Bug reports coming from internal teams first
- Engineers fixing their own pain points

**Red flags:**
- Internal teams avoid using the product
- "It's not really built for us" excuses
- Bugs only discovered by customers
- Internal workarounds instead of product fixes

## Expected Outcomes
- Higher product quality with less top-down management
- More authentic understanding of customer problems
- Faster identification and fixing of quality issues
- Increased team motivation and ownership
- Better products because builders feel the pain
- Reduced need for elaborate quality metrics and processes
- Stronger product-driven culture

## Common Pitfalls

### Pitfall 1: Forcing Unnatural Dogfooding
**Problem**: Making people use the product in ways that don't make sense, creating resentment.
**Example**: Making finance team use collaboration software when Excel is genuinely better for their needs.
**Solution**: Get creative, but respect when something else is truly better. Focus on genuine use cases.

### Pitfall 2: Blocking All Bottom-Up Work
**Problem**: PMs saying "no" to every engineer-initiated quality fix because of roadmap.
**Solution**: Reserve capacity for emergent work. Trust engineer estimates when they're motivated.

### Pitfall 3: Dogfooding Without Action
**Problem**: Everyone uses product, finds issues, but nothing changes.
**Solution**: Make it easy to log and fix dogfooding discoveries. Close the loop publicly.

### Pitfall 4: Only Dogfooding "Happy Path"
**Problem**: Internal users only use basic features, missing edge cases.
**Solution**: Actively try to break things. Incentivize finding edge cases.

### Pitfall 5: Ignoring Scale Differences
**Problem**: Your company has 50 users, product needs to work for 50,000 users.
**Solution**: Supplement dogfooding with external testing and research.

### Pitfall 6: Leadership Not Participating
**Problem**: Leadership tells everyone to use product but uses alternatives themselves.
**Solution**: Start with leadership adoption. Model the behavior.

## Real-World Examples

### Example 1: Figma's Memo to Deck Transition
**Scenario**: Figma was a memo culture (like Amazon)
**Change**: Yuhki as CPO switched to deck culture
**Result**: Now everyone creates presentations in Figma, forcing daily engagement with the product

**Impact:**
- Designers weren't the only power users
- PMs, leaders, everyone encountered issues firsthand
- Increased product improvements for presentation use cases
- Built empathy across organization

### Example 2: Uber Driver App Quality
**Scenario**: Engineers building driver app but not driving for Uber
**Solution**: Everyone at Uber took Ubers to work
**Result**: Engineers would see drivers struggling, feel personally accountable, and fix issues

**Key moment**: Engineer sees driver struggling with their feature → feels embarrassed → becomes personally motivated to fix it immediately (not because PM assigned it)

### Example 3: Figma Performance Review Calibrations
**Scenario**: Needed wider FigJam adoption
**Solution**: Head of Design created calibration template, distributed through HR
**Result**: Every manager used FigJam for performance reviews, discovered real workflows

### Example 4: Dylan Field at Yuhki's House
**Scenario**: Dylan (CEO) visiting Yuhki, needed to use bathroom
**Action**: Met Yuhki's partner who happened to be using Figma
**Result**: Dylan immediately started asking about problems and pain points with Google Fonts integration

**Lesson**: Customer obsession from the top, treating every user interaction as valuable, no matter how casual.

## AI Integration Notes

### Context Signals That Should Trigger This SOP
- User mentions product quality issues
- User asks about quality processes or metrics
- User wants to improve internal culture
- User mentions disconnect between team and customer problems
- User is building a new product or feature
- User asks about "dogfooding" or "eating your own dog food"
- User mentions low team motivation or ownership

### How to Adapt for Different Situations
- **For B2B products**: Find creative internal use cases or recruit internal proxies from similar roles
- **For B2C products**: Entire company should be users; no excuses
- **For developer tools**: Engineers must use the tool in real work
- **For hardware products**: Everyone should use the hardware daily; create "dogfooding hardware" programs
- **For enterprise-only products**: Create small internal "enterprise" scenarios to test
- **For products you're not target user for**: Heavy external beta with close partnerships

### Limitations and Edge Cases
- Some products genuinely can't be dogfooded (e.g., hospital management software when you're not a hospital)
- Scale differences matter (your company's usage may not reflect customer scale)
- Internal users may be more tech-savvy or forgiving than customers
- Can create echo chamber if only dogfooding is done (must supplement with external research)
- Some domains require specialized expertise that internal teams lack
