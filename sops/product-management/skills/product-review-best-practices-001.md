## Metadata

- **Company Stage**: All stages
- **Difficulty**: Intermediate

## Overview
Product reviews often fail because leaders give feedback from their "dinosaur brain" — instinctive reactions without understanding context. The key insight: **effective product reviews require the reviewer to experience the problem first, before seeing the solution, and the presenter to create that experience deliberately**.

## When to Use
- Running product review meetings
- Presenting work to leadership
- Giving feedback on product direction
- Designing review processes
- Coaching PMs on stakeholder management

## Prerequisites
- Understanding of cognitive biases
- Time to prepare reviews properly
- Willingness to slow down for quality
- Access to user research/context

## Core Concept: The Dinosaur Brain Problem

### What is Dinosaur Brain?
The instinctive, reactive part of leadership feedback that:
- Responds immediately without full context
- Projects personal preferences onto users
- Misses the underlying problem being solved
- Creates whiplash for product teams

**Classic dinosaur brain feedback:**
- "I don't like that color"
- "Can we make the button bigger?"
- "What if we added X feature?"
- "My friend said they wanted Y"

**Why it happens:**
- Leaders don't have context teams have
- Limited time in review meetings
- Natural instinct to contribute
- Past experiences pattern-matching

### The Problem with Traditional Reviews

**Traditional review format:**
1. Team presents solution
2. Leader reacts to solution
3. Leader gives feedback/direction
4. Team incorporates feedback
5. Repeat until leader approves

**What goes wrong:**
- Leader never experienced the problem
- Feedback is on solution, not approach
- Leader's intuition ≠ user intuition
- Cycles of revision based on preference
- Original problem gets lost

## Procedure

### Step 1: Set Up the Review Correctly
Structure the review to avoid dinosaur brain.

**Review format (in order):**
1. **Problem immersion** (5-10 min)
2. **Approach discussion** (10-15 min)
3. **Solution review** (10-15 min)
4. **Feedback and decisions** (10-15 min)

**Key principle:**
> "Before you show the solution, make the reviewer experience the problem. Let them feel the pain the user feels."

### Step 2: Create Problem Immersion
Make the reviewer feel the problem viscerally.

**Immersion techniques:**
| Technique | When to Use | Example |
|-----------|-------------|---------|
| User quote compilation | Emotional problems | "Here are 10 verbatim quotes from users about this" |
| Live demo of pain | Workflow issues | "Try to complete this task yourself" |
| Data visualization | Metric problems | "Here's the funnel — see the drop?" |
| Video clips | UX problems | "Watch this user struggle for 3 minutes" |
| Competitor comparison | Feature gaps | "Here's how competitor handles this" |
| Story narrative | Complex problems | "Let me tell you about Sarah's day..." |

**Questions to answer in immersion:**
- Who has this problem?
- How painful is it?
- How frequent is it?
- What do they do today?
- Why does it matter?

**Example:**
> "Before I show you our checkout redesign, I want you to experience our current checkout. Here's what happens: [walks through 47-second checkout flow]. Now let's watch three users try to complete this: [video of frustrated users]. Finally, here's our abandonment data: [shows 68% cart abandonment]."

### Step 3: Discuss Approach Before Solution
Align on how you're solving before showing what you're building.

**Approach discussion content:**
- Problem statement (verified in Step 2)
- Solution principles/criteria
- Key trade-offs considered
- Alternatives evaluated
- Why this approach wins

**Format:**
> "Given this problem, we could: (A) simplify the flow, (B) add more guidance, or (C) offer alternative payment methods. We chose A because [reasons]. Do you agree with this direction before I show the specifics?"

**Why this matters:**
- Gets alignment on approach first
- Prevents solution-level feedback about approach issues
- Surfaces fundamental disagreements early
- Makes solution feedback more focused

### Step 4: Present Solution with Context
Now show the solution with decision rationale.

**Solution presentation structure:**
1. Brief reminder of problem + approach
2. Walk through the solution
3. Highlight key decisions
4. Show supporting data/research
5. Call out known trade-offs

**What to include:**
- User journey before/after
- Key design decisions with rationale
- What you explicitly chose NOT to do
- Success metrics and measurement plan
- Known risks and mitigation

**What NOT to do:**
- Jump straight to mockups
- Hide the rationale
- Present as final/fixed
- Ignore alternatives considered

### Step 5: Guide the Feedback
Help reviewers give better feedback.

**Feedback prompts:**
- "Does this approach match your understanding of the problem?"
- "What risks do you see that we haven't addressed?"
- "What's unclear about our rationale?"
- "Where do you disagree with our trade-offs?"

**Redirect dinosaur brain:**
| Dinosaur Brain | Redirect |
|----------------|----------|
| "I don't like the blue" | "What about the blue concerns you? Does it relate to our user needs?" |
| "Can we add X?" | "How would that help with the problem we defined?" |
| "My wife said Y" | "Interesting — does that match what we're seeing in user research?" |
| "What if we..." | "Let me note that — does it change our approach or is it an execution detail?" |

### Step 6: Document and Follow Up
Capture decisions and next steps clearly.

**Meeting output:**
- Decisions made (with reasoning)
- Open questions to resolve
- Feedback to incorporate
- Feedback considered but rejected (with reasoning)
- Next review checkpoint

**Key documentation:**
> "Feedback received: [X]. Decision: [incorporate/reject]. Reasoning: [why]. Owner: [who]."

## The Fascination Technique

### Using "Fascinating" to Stay Curious
When you receive feedback you disagree with, say "fascinating" to yourself.

**The technique:**
1. Hear feedback you think is wrong
2. Say (internally or externally): "Fascinating"
3. Ask: "Tell me more about why you think that"
4. Seek to understand the underlying concern
5. Then respond constructively

**Why it works:**
- Prevents defensive reaction
- Creates space for dialogue
- Often reveals legitimate underlying concern
- Even if wrong, shows respect
- Might actually learn something

**Example:**
> Leader: "We should add a tutorial for this"
> Dinosaur response: "No, that adds friction"
> Fascination response: "Fascinating — what makes you think users need more guidance here? Have you seen something I haven't?"

## Expected Outcomes
- Higher quality feedback
- Fewer review cycles
- Better alignment with leadership
- More user-centered discussions
- Reduced "preference-based" direction

## Common Pitfalls

### Skipping problem immersion
- Leader hasn't felt the problem
- Feedback based on personal preference
- Solution discussion without context
- Approach misalignment emerges late

### Showing solution too early
- "Let me just show you what we built"
- No framework for evaluating
- Feedback is scattered
- Hard to know what to incorporate

### Treating all feedback as equal
- Executive preference ≠ user need
- Personal opinion ≠ strategic direction
- Not distinguishing approach from execution feedback
- Incorporating everything blindly

### Getting defensive
- "You don't understand"
- Fighting the feedback
- Not seeking underlying concern
- Damaging the relationship

### Not documenting decisions
- Same feedback next review
- No paper trail
- Debates repeat
- Progress unclear

## AI Integration Notes

### Context signals that should trigger this SOP:
- "How do I present to leadership?"
- Product review preparation
- "My exec keeps changing direction"
- Stakeholder feedback issues

### How to apply:
- Structure review with problem immersion first
- Prepare approach discussion before solution
- Guide feedback with good prompts
- Use "fascinating" technique for disagreements

### Key insight:
Most bad product review feedback comes from leaders not experiencing the problem. Create that experience deliberately, and the feedback quality transforms. Leaders aren't being difficult — they're just missing context you have.
