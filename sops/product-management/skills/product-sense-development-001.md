- **Applicable To**: Product Managers, Designers, Product Leaders
- **Company Stage**: All stages
- **Difficulty**: Intermediate

## Overview
Product sense is the ability to consistently make decisions that lead to high-impact, successful products. It's not a mystical intuition — it's a learnable skill built through deliberate practice and pattern recognition. The key insight: **product sense comes from studying many examples, building mental models, and then applying those patterns to new situations**.

## When to Use
- Evaluating product decisions
- Developing PM skills
- Interviewing product candidates
- Building product intuition
- Making feature tradeoffs
- Coaching junior PMs

## Prerequisites
- Curiosity about products
- Access to diverse product examples
- Willingness to analyze and reflect
- Time for deliberate practice

## Core Concept: The Three Components

### 1. Cognitive Empathy
**Definition**: Understanding what users need, even when they can't articulate it themselves.

**Key questions:**
- What problem is the user actually trying to solve?
- What are they doing before and after using our product?
- What would make them delighted?

**Building this skill:**
- Talk to users regularly (not just through surveys)
- Watch people use products (yours and others)
- Ask "why" five times to get to root motivations

### 2. Domain Knowledge
**Definition**: Deep understanding of the space you're operating in.

**Components:**
- Competitive landscape
- Market dynamics
- Technical constraints
- Business model implications

**Building this skill:**
- Use competitor products extensively
- Read industry analysis and news
- Understand the technology stack
- Study successful and failed products in your space

### 3. Pattern Recognition
**Definition**: Recognizing situations you've seen before and applying learned solutions.

**How patterns work:**
- "This is similar to the Netflix recommendation problem"
- "This is a classic marketplace chicken-and-egg"
- "This looks like a viral loop opportunity"

**Building this skill:**
- Study many product case studies
- Analyze why products succeeded or failed
- Build a mental library of patterns

## Procedure: Developing Product Sense

### Step 1: Consume Products Deliberately
Don't just use products — study them.

**Practice:**
- Pick 5 products you use regularly
- For each, ask:
  - What problem does this solve?
  - Who is the target user?
  - What's the core value proposition?
  - What's the business model?
  - What makes it hard to copy?

### Step 2: Analyze Product Decisions
When you see a product change, ask why.

**Questions to ask:**
- What problem were they trying to solve?
- What alternatives did they likely consider?
- What tradeoffs did they make?
- Did it work? How would you know?

**Example exercise:**
When Instagram adds a feature, write down:
1. Your hypothesis for why they added it
2. What metrics they're likely tracking
3. Whether you think it will succeed and why

### Step 3: Build Your Pattern Library
Document patterns you observe.

**Pattern categories:**
- Onboarding patterns (progressive disclosure, empty states)
- Engagement patterns (notifications, streaks, social proof)
- Monetization patterns (freemium, trials, upsells)
- Growth patterns (referrals, viral loops, network effects)

**For each pattern, note:**
- What problem it solves
- When it works well
- When it fails
- Examples of good execution

### Step 4: Practice Making Predictions
Before you see the outcome, make a prediction.

**Exercises:**
- When a product launches, predict if it will succeed
- When you ship a feature, predict the metrics impact
- When a company IPOs, predict the trajectory

**Track your predictions:**
- Write them down with reasoning
- Review after 3-6 months
- Learn from misses

### Step 5: Get Reps Through Side Projects
Building products accelerates learning.

**Options:**
- Build a small product yourself
- Contribute to open source
- Help a friend with their startup
- Do product consulting

**Why this works:**
- Forces you through the full decision cycle
- Creates real feedback loops
- Builds empathy for constraints

### Step 6: Seek Diverse Feedback
Your blind spots need external input.

**Sources of feedback:**
- User research (what users actually do)
- Metrics (what the data shows)
- Team critique (what colleagues see)
- External reviews (what outsiders think)

**Julie's approach:**
> "The best PMs I know are constantly seeking disconfirming evidence. They want to be proven wrong early."

## Expected Outcomes
- More confident product decisions
- Better intuition for what will work
- Faster pattern recognition
- Improved ability to predict outcomes
- Stronger product critique skills

## Common Pitfalls

### Confusing opinions with product sense
- Having strong opinions isn't product sense
- Product sense is about accuracy, not confidence
- Track your prediction accuracy

### Only studying successful products
- Failed products teach you what doesn't work
- Survivorship bias skews learning
- Study failures deliberately

### Not getting enough reps
- Reading about products isn't enough
- You need to make decisions and see outcomes
- Seek opportunities to ship

### Copying without understanding
- Patterns aren't templates to copy blindly
- Understand why a pattern works
- Consider context differences

## Related SOPs
- User Research Framework
- Product Review Meeting Structure
- Design Feedback Framework

## AI Integration Notes

### Context signals that should trigger this SOP:
- User asks "how do I develop product sense?"
- Questions about PM skill development
- Evaluating product decisions
- Coaching or mentoring PMs

### How to apply:
- Emphasize deliberate practice over intuition
- Encourage pattern library building
- Suggest prediction tracking
- Connect to specific product examples

### Key insight:
Product sense isn't magical — it's the result of studying many examples, building mental models, and getting feedback on your predictions. Anyone can develop it with deliberate practice.
