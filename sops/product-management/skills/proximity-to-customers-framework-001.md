## Overview
Maintaining obsessive proximity to customers is critical for building beloved products. This framework, demonstrated by Figma's origin story and continued practices, shows how to systematically stay close to customers even as you scale, creating evangelists who help shape and spread your product.

## When to Use
- When building product in a new or skeptical market
- When scaling from small to large customer base
- When product decisions feel disconnected from real user needs
- When trying to build community-led growth
- When customer feedback feels filtered or abstracted
- When evaluating product quality and direction

## Prerequisites
- Active customer base (even if small)
- Customer communication channels (support, social media, community)
- Leadership commitment to customer proximity
- Willingness to engage directly with individual users

## Procedure

### Step 1: Understand the Origin Story Principle
**Purpose**: Learn from how proximity creates believers

**Figma's founding approach (Dylan Field):**
- Built design editor in the browser (seemed like science fiction)
- No one believed it was possible
- Consistently put product in front of designers
- Asked for feedback
- **Came back with feedback implemented**
- Made it better and better iteratively
- Never expected immediate adoption
- Focused on listening and making evangelists

**Key insight**: The goal wasn't conversion—it was building believers through demonstrated listening and iteration.

**Result**: Deep connection with community who helped shape the product and became advocates.

**Your application:**
1. Identify your "design editor in browser" skeptical moment
2. Find early users/community willing to give feedback
3. Build rapid feedback loop: show → listen → implement → show again
4. Focus on making believers before making customers
5. Let them shape the product with you

### Step 2: Build a Balanced Portfolio of Feedback Sources
**Purpose**: Avoid blind spots by gathering diverse input types

**Figma's portfolio approach:**

| Feedback Source | What It Reveals | Who It Represents | Bias to Watch |
|----------------|-----------------|-------------------|---------------|
| Twitter/Social Media | Community sentiment, trending issues | Vocal minority, often designers | Over-indexes on edge cases, negativity |
| Support Tickets | Problems and dissatisfaction | Struggling users | Skews negative, lacks context on what works |
| Sales Conversations | Perceptions, competitive positioning | Prospects and decision-makers | Pre-sale perspective, may not reflect actual usage |
| Community Forums | Feature requests, use cases | Power users, enthusiasts | May not represent typical users |
| User Research | Deep behavioral insights | Representative samples | Slower, requires planning |
| Product Analytics | Actual behavior patterns | All users | Lacks the "why" behind behaviors |

**The principle**: Each source is a partial view. PMs need the full portfolio to avoid blind spots.

**Scaling challenge**:
> "The Figma team is very good at Twitter and staying on top of the sentiments. And luckily for us, a lot of designers are on Twitter, but the reality is that most of our audience, at this point, probably aren't."

**Action items:**
1. Audit your current feedback sources
2. Identify which sources you're over-relying on
3. Identify which customer segments are underrepresented
4. Build new feedback channels for blind spots
5. Create regular review cadence for each source type

### Step 3: Treat Individual Users as Canaries, Not Just Data Points
**Purpose**: Early weak signals often matter more than strong signals

**Dylan Field's practice:**
- Reads the most customer feedback of anyone at Figma
- Has done this for 10 years (since founding)
- Looks at tweets with one like, sometimes zero likes
- Not viral complaints—individual voices
- "There's an essence of truth" even in single quiet voices
- Created "Concerning Tweets" private channel for the leadership team

**The "Concerning Tweets" pattern:**

**Problem**: CEO was sharing concerning user feedback in public channels
**Side effect**: Teams felt they had to drop everything to address each tweet
**Solution**: Created private "Concerning Tweets" channel
**Members**: Small leadership group (CEO, CTO, CPO)
**Purpose**: CEO can share without triggering panic; leadership team triages

**What makes a tweet "concerning" (not necessarily viral):**
- Contains "essence of truth" about a real problem
- Signals something potentially bigger
- Reflects experience that might be widespread but unspoken
- Points to systemic issues, not just edge cases

**Your implementation:**
1. **For leaders**: Create private channel for weak signals you find concerning
2. **For PMs**: Don't dismiss feedback just because it's not widespread yet
3. **For teams**: Treat individual feedback as potential canary, investigate deeper
4. **Balance**: Don't overreact to every individual voice, but don't ignore them

### Step 4: Leadership Models Customer Obsession
**Purpose**: Culture is set from the top

**Dylan Field's customer obsession examples:**

**Example 1: Reading feedback constantly**
- 10 years of daily customer feedback reading
- Reads MORE customer feedback than anyone else in company
- Not delegated, personally engaged
- Drops concerning tweets into leadership channels

**Example 2: Impromptu user testing**
- Yuhki's partner happened to be using Figma when Dylan visited
- Dylan immediately engaged: "What are the biggest problems?"
- Started geeking out on Google Fonts issue
- First major interaction between them was about product feedback
- Didn't matter it was social setting—customer insight was valuable

**The lesson**: Every user interaction is an opportunity to learn, no matter how casual the setting.

**For product leaders:**
1. **Make it visible**: Share customer feedback you read with team
2. **Make it personal**: Talk to users directly, not just through reports
3. **Make it regular**: Build it into your calendar/habits
4. **Make it authentic**: Actually care about individual experiences

**For teams:**
- Model the founder/leader behavior
- Share stories of customer interactions
- Celebrate customer proximity
- Make it culturally valuable to stay close

### Step 5: Create Systematic Proximity Practices
**Purpose**: Scale personal connection as company grows

**Tactical practices from Figma:**

**1. Direct social media engagement:**
- Product leaders (like Sho on Yuhki's team) tweet to community
- "We're thinking about focusing on prototyping. What are your top problems?"
- Community responds with passionate feedback
- Team reads all responses, gets pulse on sentiment
- Not just for implementation—for understanding

**2. Community programs (Friends of Figma):**
- People passionate about Figma across different geographies
- Come together in Discord channel
- Meet regularly
- Help evangelize Figma
- Creates human connection between users and between users and company
- Builds loyalty that fuels internal champions

**3. Customer advisory boards:**
- For specialized use cases (like design systems, branching/merging)
- Regular check-ins with actual users
- Especially important when building features your team doesn't use internally

**4. Support rotation:**
- Team members spend time on support tickets
- See real problems, not filtered summaries
- Build empathy through direct contact

**Your implementation checklist:**
- [ ] PMs spend X hours/week reading customer feedback directly
- [ ] Leadership shares customer stories in team meetings
- [ ] Regular community engagement through social/forums
- [ ] Customer advisory board for key segments
- [ ] Support rotation for product team
- [ ] Community programs for super users
- [ ] Regular customer interviews (weekly/bi-weekly)

### Step 6: Use Proximity to Validate Product Decisions
**Purpose**: Test intuition against reality

**Dylan Field's intuition building:**
> "Dylan is very based on intuition and instinct. And that intuition is actually built off of thousands and hundreds of thousands of customer interactions where he might look at something and be like, 'You know what? This isn't going to land well,' or, 'Here's the biggest problem right now.'"

**The pattern:**
1. Massive customer exposure (thousands of interactions)
2. Builds intuition about what will/won't work
3. Can't always explain why—just knows
4. Product leader's job: Build out the logic to help others understand

**How to build your intuition:**
- Quantity matters: Need many interactions, not just a few
- Depth matters: Need real conversations, not just surveys
- Consistency matters: Regular exposure over years, not sprints
- Visceral matters: Need to see/feel reactions, not just read summaries

**Testing intuition:**
- Check your hunches against actual customer feedback
- When you're wrong, dig into why
- When you're right, document the pattern
- Share your reasoning so team can learn

## Expected Outcomes
- Product decisions grounded in real customer needs
- Early warning system for problems before they grow
- Customer evangelists who help spread product
- Reduced need for formal research (though still valuable)
- Stronger product intuition across team
- Community that feels heard and valued
- Higher product-market fit
- More authentic product direction

## Common Pitfalls

### Pitfall 1: Vocal Minority Bias
**Problem**: Over-indexing on loud Twitter voices who may not represent typical users.
**Solution**: Balance with usage data, support tickets, and research with representative samples.

### Pitfall 2: Reactive Product Development
**Problem**: Jumping to build every piece of feedback without strategy.
**Solution**: Use feedback as input, not directive. See Step 6 of PM Ownership of Why SOP.

### Pitfall 3: Filtering Too Much
**Problem**: Creating layers between leadership and raw customer feedback.
**Solution**: Leaders must read raw feedback, not just summaries. Accept some noise.

### Pitfall 4: Only Talking to Happy Customers
**Problem**: Sales conversations represent prospects; support represents unhappy users.
**Solution**: Deliberately seek out average users and barely-engaged users too.

### Pitfall 5: Proximity Theater
**Problem**: Doing customer research for show without actually letting it influence decisions.
**Solution**: Make customer proximity visible in decision-making. "We learned from customers that..."

### Pitfall 6: Losing Proximity While Scaling
**Problem**: As company grows, customer gets abstracted into personas and data.
**Solution**: Institutionalize proximity practices (Step 5) and leadership modeling (Step 4).

## Real-World Examples

### Example 1: Figma's Origin Story
**Context**: Building browser-based design tool no one believed was possible
**Practice**: Repeatedly showed product to designers, got feedback, implemented it, came back
**Outcome**: Never expected immediate adoption, focused on making believers
**Result**: Deep community connection, shaped product together, created evangelists

### Example 2: Branching and Merging Feature
**Context**: Complex feature for design systems, didn't see initial adoption
**Challenge**: "We don't really use it that much ourselves" (Figma's small team)
**Solution**: Had to be creative about understanding effectiveness through:
- External customer advisory boards
- Frequent check-ins with design system teams
- Performance improvements based on feedback
- Helping customers implement workflows

**Lesson**: When you're not the target user, proximity becomes even more critical.

### Example 3: The Concerning Tweets Channel
**Pattern**: Dylan finds tweet with zero or one like
**Action**: Shares in private leadership channel
**Triage**: Small group assesses if it signals something bigger
**Outcome**: Caught early issues before they became widespread problems

**Example tweet theme**: Small UX issue that reflects underlying system problem

### Example 4: Dylan at Yuhki's House
**Setup**: Social visit, partner using Figma for work
**Dylan's response**: Immediately asks about biggest problems
**Discussion**: Deep dive into Google Fonts integration issues
**Takeaway**: Every user is an opportunity to learn, even in casual settings

**After 10 years**: Still maintains this level of curiosity and care about individual experiences.

## AI Integration Notes

### Context Signals That Should Trigger This SOP
- User mentions feeling disconnected from customers
- User asks how to gather customer feedback
- User is building PLG or community-led product
- User wants to improve product-market fit
- User is scaling team and worried about losing customer connection
- User mentions "customer-centric" or "customer-obsessed" culture
- User asks about research processes
- User mentions product decisions feeling arbitrary

### How to Adapt for Different Situations
- **For early-stage startups**: Focus heavily on Steps 1-3; make proximity your advantage
- **For scaling companies**: Emphasize Steps 5-6; institutionalize practices
- **For B2B products**: Adapt Step 5 for longer sales cycles and multiple stakeholders
- **For PLG companies**: Twitter/community engagement (Step 5) is especially valuable
- **For enterprise products**: Customer advisory boards and direct relationships matter more
- **For technical products**: Developers may be on GitHub/Stack Overflow vs Twitter
- **For consumer products**: Need representative research, not just vocal users

### Limitations and Edge Cases
- Some markets aren't active on social media (need different channels)
- Enterprise buyers aren't always end users (need both buyer and user proximity)
- At massive scale, can't read all feedback (need sampling strategies)
- Negative feedback is typically over-represented (balance with satisfaction data)
- Cultural/language barriers in global products (need local community managers)
- Highly technical products may need specialized customer proxies internally
