- **Company Stage**: All stages
- **Difficulty**: Intermediate

## Overview
Product work operates at three distinct levels: **Impact**, **Execution**, and **Optics**. Understanding which level you and others are operating at explains much of the conflict in product teams. The key insight: **most tension arises when people are thinking at different levels without realizing it**.

## When to Use
- Diagnosing team conflicts
- Preparing for product reviews with executives
- Understanding career development
- Aligning with stakeholders
- Coaching product managers
- Evaluating organizational culture

## Prerequisites
- Self-awareness about your default level
- Understanding of stakeholder perspectives
- Willingness to shift levels as needed

## Core Concept: The Three Levels

### Level 1: Impact
**Definition**: What is the outcome for customers and the business?

**Focus areas:**
- Customer experience improvement
- Business metrics movement
- Long-term value creation
- Brand implications

**Who defaults here:**
- CEOs and founders
- Senior executives
- Board members
- Customer advocates

**Questions at this level:**
- Will this make customers' lives better?
- How does this affect our brand?
- What's the long-term impact?
- Is this the right outcome?

### Level 2: Execution
**Definition**: What does it take to get things done?

**Focus areas:**
- Hitting milestones
- Solving immediate problems
- Resource allocation
- Technical implementation

**Who defaults here:**
- Product managers (especially junior/mid)
- Engineering managers
- Project managers
- Operations leaders

**Questions at this level:**
- How do we ship this?
- What's the timeline?
- What resources do we need?
- What are the dependencies?

### Level 3: Optics
**Definition**: Creating awareness of impact and execution.

**Focus areas:**
- Communication and visibility
- Stakeholder management
- Status updates
- Building excitement

**Who defaults here:**
- Marketing teams
- Some executives
- Platform/infrastructure teams
- Teams seeking resources

**Questions at this level:**
- How do we communicate this?
- Who needs to know?
- Are we getting credit for our work?
- How do we build support?

## Procedure

### Step 1: Identify Your Default Level
Recognize where you naturally operate.

**Self-assessment questions:**
- When preparing for a meeting, what do you focus on first?
- What frustrates you most when it's missing?
- What do you gravitate toward in conversations?

**Mapping your default:**
| If you typically... | You default to... |
|---------------------|-------------------|
| Ask "Why are we doing this?" | Impact |
| Ask "How will we do this?" | Execution |
| Ask "Who needs to know about this?" | Optics |

### Step 2: Identify Stakeholder Levels
Map where others are operating.

**CEO pattern:**
- Usually thinking at Impact level
- Cares about customer experience
- Concerned about brand implications
- May seem to "miss" execution constraints

**PM pattern:**
- Usually thinking at Execution level
- Focused on shipping and timelines
- Managing dependencies
- May seem to "miss" bigger picture

**Marketing pattern:**
- Often thinking at Optics level
- Focused on messaging and communication
- Building awareness and excitement
- May seem to "miss" execution reality

### Step 3: Diagnose Level Mismatches
Recognize when conflict comes from operating at different levels.

**Common conflict patterns:**

**PM vs CEO:**
- PM explains execution constraints
- CEO asks impact questions
- PM thinks CEO "doesn't get it"
- CEO thinks PM "isn't strategic"
- Reality: Operating at different levels

**PM vs Marketing:**
- PM focused on shipping
- Marketing focused on communication
- PM thinks Marketing "just wants credit"
- Marketing thinks PM "doesn't value visibility"
- Reality: Different default levels

**Example scenario:**
> PM presents to CEO about a feature with a customer service compromise. PM explains the rational tradeoff with the VP of Customer Support. CEO asks "Why is customer service going to be poor?" PM explains the execution constraints. Meeting goes poorly.
>
> **What happened:** PM was at Execution level (explaining constraints). CEO was at Impact level (asking about customer experience). Neither recognized the mismatch.

### Step 4: Shift Levels Strategically
Move to the appropriate level for the context.

**When to shift to Impact:**
- Executive presentations
- Strategic planning
- Major product decisions
- Customer-facing discussions

**When to shift to Execution:**
- Sprint planning
- Technical reviews
- Resource allocation
- Problem-solving sessions

**When to shift to Optics:**
- Launch communications
- Stakeholder updates
- Building team morale
- Securing resources

**Tactical approach:**
- Start at the level your audience defaults to
- Translate your concerns into their level
- Bridge between levels explicitly

### Step 5: Use Level Language Deliberately
Match your communication to the level needed.

**Impact language:**
- "This will improve customer experience by..."
- "The long-term value is..."
- "This protects our brand because..."

**Execution language:**
- "To make this happen, we need..."
- "The timeline requires..."
- "Our dependencies are..."

**Optics language:**
- "We should communicate this by..."
- "The teams that need visibility are..."
- "Here's how we'll share progress..."

### Step 6: Align Team on Context-Appropriate Level
Decide as a team which level to prioritize.

**Early stage startup:**
- Often best to optimize for Execution
- Have impact thesis, but focus on shipping
- Optics is minimal (small team)

**Scaling company:**
- Balance shifts toward Impact
- Execution is established
- Optics becomes more important

**Platform/Infrastructure team:**
- May need more Optics investment
- Visibility helps secure resources
- Internal "marketing" is legitimate

## Expected Outcomes
- Fewer unexplained conflicts
- Better executive communication
- More effective stakeholder management
- Clearer career development path
- Better organizational diagnosis

## Common Pitfalls

### Confusing levels with value
- All three levels matter
- Optics isn't inherently bad
- Execution without impact is wasted
- Impact without optics may go unnoticed

### Organizations that over-index on optics
- Status updates become the goal
- Appearance matters more than results
- High performers get frustrated
- Created by rewarding optics over impact

**Signs of optics over-indexing:**
- All-hands celebrate launches, not results
- Status updates are praised more than outcomes
- People spend more time on slides than shipping

### Not adapting to your audience
- PMs often stay at Execution in exec meetings
- Executives can seem "disconnected" from reality
- Recognize and bridge the gap

### Judging others for different defaults
- CEOs aren't "out of touch"
- PMs aren't "not strategic"
- Marketing isn't "just optics"
- Different roles require different defaults

## AI Integration Notes

### Context signals that should trigger this SOP:
- User mentions conflict with executives
- Questions about why meetings go poorly
- "My CEO doesn't understand..."
- Team alignment issues

### How to apply:
- Help identify which level each party is at
- Suggest language translation between levels
- Diagnose organizational over-indexing
- Guide context-appropriate level selection

### Key insight:
Most product conflicts aren't about disagreement on substance — they're about people operating at different levels without recognizing it. Making levels explicit resolves most tension.
