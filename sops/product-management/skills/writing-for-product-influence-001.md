- **Domain**: Product Management / Communication
- **Type**: Process + Framework
- **Applicable To**: Product Managers, Product Leaders, Technical Leaders
- **Difficulty**: Intermediate to Advanced

## Overview
A systematic approach to using writing as a career accelerator and organizational influence tool. This framework shows how to crystallize mental models through writing, scale your impact within growing organizations, and build external credibility that enhances internal influence.

## When to Use
- When you're figuring out complex frameworks and need to solidify your thinking
- When joining or working at a fast-growing company with constant new hires
- When you want to influence beyond your immediate team
- When building credibility with senior leadership
- When onboarding becomes a bottleneck for your team
- When you notice repeated questions or concepts that need documentation
- When you want to accelerate your career trajectory

## Prerequisites
- Active experience doing product work (you must be learning while doing)
- Mental models or frameworks forming in your mind (even if not fully crystallized)
- Willingness to invest 40+ hours per substantive post
- Comfort with feedback and iteration
- Access to colleagues for draft review
- Not required: Being an expert or having it "all figured out"

## Procedure

### Step 1: Identify What to Write About

**Write While Learning, Not After**
- Don't wait until you're an expert
- Write to figure out what you think (Hemingway: "I don't know what I think until I've written it down")
- Target topics you're wrestling with in real-time
- Look for mental models forming intuitively that need structure

**Finding Topics**
- What decisions or frameworks are you developing right now?
- What chaos in your mind needs disambiguation?
- What are you learning from rapid role changes or company growth?
- What frameworks would have helped you 3-6 months ago?
- What do new team members keep asking about?

**Contrast and Change as Fuel**
- "I was able to contrast things because it was literally like, 'Oh wait, three months ago, it was that. Now, how do I change?'"
- Rapid growth phases provide rich material
- Role transitions surface new mental models
- Company scaling exposes new challenges

### Step 2: Brain Dump First Draft

**Initial Writing Session (2-4 hours)**
- Block dedicated time with no interruptions
- Write stream-of-consciousness without editing
- Get all thoughts out, even if they don't make sense
- Don't worry about structure, clarity, or quality
- Goal: Raw material to work with

**Capture Everything**
- Your current thinking (even if incomplete)
- Examples from your work
- Contrasts you've noticed
- Questions you're trying to answer
- Framework elements that are emerging

### Step 3: Deep Editing and Refinement (36-40 hours)

**Structural Editing**
- Organize brain dump into logical flow
- Identify the core argument or framework
- Build clear narrative arc
- Remove tangents and redundancy
- Add transitions between ideas

**Clarity Enhancement**
- Rewrite every sentence for precision
- Eliminate jargon where possible
- Add concrete examples
- Create diagrams or visuals where helpful
- Test: Can someone with less context understand this?

**Quality Iteration**
- Read out loud to catch awkward phrasing
- Check for logical gaps
- Ensure every paragraph serves the main point
- Polish until it's something you're proud of
- Budget: 40 hours total including initial draft

### Step 4: Get Feedback Fearlessly

**Early Sharing (Before It's "Ready")**
- Share raw, early thoughts with trusted colleagues
- Don't be afraid for it to not make sense initially
- "Get feedback from people. Don't be so afraid to share raw, early thoughts"

**What You Learn**
- How you construct narrative vs. how people receive it
- Gaps in logic you couldn't see
- Where examples would help
- What resonates vs. what confuses
- Difference between what's in your head and what's on the page

**Who to Ask**
- Objective readers without your context
- People in your target audience
- Senior leaders whose opinion matters
- Peers who will be honest
- At least 3-5 readers before publishing

**Incorporating Feedback**
- Listen for patterns across readers
- Don't defensive—use it to improve
- Rewrite sections that consistently confuse
- Add clarity where multiple people stumble
- Build confidence through iteration

### Step 5: Publish and Distribute

**External Publication Benefits**
- "Writing externally and getting momentum externally was a better way to influence internally"
- Cuts through organizational noise
- Builds credibility with leadership
- Attracts talent to your organization
- Creates lasting reference material

**Internal Distribution**
- Share in company channels
- Reference in onboarding materials
- Link in relevant discussions
- Use as training for new team members

**Managing Expectations**
- Don't write purely for virality
- "The ROI is already huge" even without external traction
- Focus on crystallizing your thinking first
- External validation is bonus, not requirement

### Step 6: Leverage the Compounding Benefits

**Internal Influence**
- Use posts to influence what 200+ person orgs focus on
- Get leadership attention: "Tobi would read my post... and he'd be like, 'Great post'"
- Build "trust battery" with executives through demonstrated thinking
- Create shared language and frameworks for the organization

**Onboarding at Scale**
- New team members read your posts before joining
- "People that would join my team already knew how I thought"
- Dramatically reduces onboarding time
- Sets expectations and culture from day one
- "I didn't really even have to onboard many people in so many ways"

**Talent Attraction**
- "Every week a new PM messages me and says like, 'Hey. I just joined. Your post had a lot of influence on me'"
- Attracts people who align with your thinking
- Pre-qualifies cultural fit
- Builds your personal brand as a leader

**External Credibility → Internal Impact**
- External thought leaders sharing your work
- "David Marcus... shared it on his Facebook and on Twitter"
- Senior leaders notice external validation
- Elevates your perceived expertise internally
- Opens doors to new opportunities

**Career Acceleration**
- "It accelerated my career probably a decade"
- Creates opportunities you can't predict
- Builds network and reputation
- Demonstrates clarity of thought to leadership
- Provides leverage in role negotiations

### Step 7: Release and Clear Your Mind

**Psychological Benefit**
- "It's a release too, because when you write it down, you just kind of release it from your mind"
- Stops frameworks from "floating around" in your head
- Clears mental space for new thinking
- Creates external reference so you don't have to remember
- "You cleared your mind and you can actually think. You build on top of that knowledge"

**Building on Previous Work**
- Each post becomes foundation for next thinking
- Reference your own frameworks in future work
- Compound your intellectual development
- Create a body of thought over time

## Expected Outcomes

**Immediate Benefits**
- Crystallized mental models and frameworks
- Cleared mental space for new problems
- Improved ability to articulate your thinking
- Better written communication skills

**Medium-Term Benefits (3-12 months)**
- Enhanced internal influence
- Faster team onboarding
- Increased credibility with leadership
- Better talent attraction
- Shared organizational language

**Long-Term Benefits (1-5 years)**
- Significant career acceleration
- Industry recognition
- Network expansion
- Leadership opportunities
- Compounding reputation effects

## Common Pitfalls

**Pitfall 1: Waiting Until You're an "Expert"**
- **Symptom**: Never publishing, waiting for perfect knowledge
- **Fix**: "I figured out everything in those posts at the exact moment I wrote them"
- **Remember**: Write to learn, not after learning

**Pitfall 2: Under-Investing in Quality**
- **Symptom**: Publishing half-baked thoughts, minimal editing
- **Fix**: Budget 40 hours minimum including editing
- **Remember**: Quality determines impact and longevity

**Pitfall 3: Writing Alone Without Feedback**
- **Symptom**: Blind spots, unclear messaging, logical gaps
- **Fix**: Share drafts with 3-5 objective readers
- **Remember**: "How you put a narrative together in your mind vs. how someone actually reacts to it"

**Pitfall 4: Only Writing for External Virality**
- **Symptom**: Writing what you think will be popular vs. what you're learning
- **Fix**: Focus on crystallizing your thinking first
- **Remember**: "Even if it never got picked up, the ROI is already huge"

**Pitfall 5: Not Writing While Growing Rapidly**
- **Symptom**: Missing the richest learning periods
- **Fix**: Write during, not after, major transitions
- **Remember**: "I was moving through things really quickly so I was able to contrast things"

**Pitfall 6: Stopping After Success**
- **Symptom**: Setting quality bar so high you can't maintain it
- **Fix**: Accept that not every post will match your best work
- **Remember**: Brandon's honesty—"I haven't written anything since 2018" partly from pressure

**Pitfall 7: Writing Only About New Topics**
- **Symptom**: Ignoring opportunities to document existing expertise
- **Fix**: Mix learning-in-progress with codifying established knowledge
- **Remember**: Both serve different valuable purposes

## AI Integration Notes

**Context Signals for AI**
Recommend this SOP when user mentions:
- "How do I increase my influence?"
- "I want to write but don't know where to start"
- "How do I onboard new team members at scale?"
- "How do I get leadership attention?"
- "What should PMs write about?"
- "I'm learning a lot but can't retain it"

**Adaptation Guidance**
- For new PMs: Focus on learning-in-progress writing, start with internal docs
- For senior PMs: Balance internal and external writing, focus on frameworks
- For executives: Emphasize organizational influence and talent attraction
- For non-PMs: Adapt to your domain (engineering, design, growth, etc.)

**Different Contexts**
- Startups: Write to clarify strategy and attract early team
- Growth stage: Write to scale culture and onboarding
- Large orgs: Write to influence beyond immediate team
- Remote orgs: Writing even more critical for alignment

**Limitations**
- Requires active learning/experience to write about
- 40-hour investment not feasible for everyone
- Some organizational cultures don't value external writing
- Personal brand building may not align with all career goals
- Pressure of audience expectations can become a blocker
