- **Source**: Paul Adams (CPO, Intercom) - Lenny's Podcast
- **Domain**: Product Management & Strategy
- **Type**: Framework
- **Applicable To**: Product Leaders, CPOs, Founders, Product Managers
- **Company Stage**: All stages, particularly critical for established products
- **Difficulty**: Intermediate

## Overview
A systematic framework for evaluating whether AI represents an existential threat or transformative opportunity for your product. This approach helps product leaders move from AI hype to strategic action by mapping product capabilities against AI capabilities to identify replacement vs. augmentation opportunities.

## When to Use
- When evaluating how AI should fit into your product strategy
- When leadership is debating whether to invest heavily in AI
- When competitors are launching AI features and you need to respond strategically
- During annual or quarterly strategic planning sessions
- When seeing early signals that AI could disrupt your category

## Prerequisites
- Clear understanding of your product's core value proposition
- Knowledge of your customer's key jobs to be done
- Familiarity with current AI capabilities (LLMs, vision models, etc.)
- Executive alignment on the importance of the assessment

## Procedure

### Step 1: Return to Product Fundamentals
Start by documenting your product's core premise, independent of AI considerations.

- **Define the core problem**: What specific problem does your product solve?
- **Identify why people use it**: What's the primary job customers hire your product for?
- **Document the value delivery**: How does your product currently deliver value?
- **Map the user workflow**: What are the key steps users take to get value?

**Example from Intercom**:
- Core problem: Customers have questions about a business
- Why people use it: To provide customer support at scale
- Value delivery: Conversational messaging between customers and support teams
- Key workflow: Customer asks question → Support rep responds → Issue resolved

### Step 2: Assess AI Capability Mapping
Evaluate what AI can currently do or will soon be able to do against your product's functions.

**Current AI Capabilities (as of 2024-2026):**
- Write and generate text
- Summarize large volumes of text
- Answer complex queries
- Find and extract facts
- Scan and analyze text
- Scan and analyze images/video
- Listen to and replicate voice
- Take actions based on instructions
- Build rules and workflows
- Reason and make deductions

**For each core product function, ask:**
- Can AI do this today? (Yes/Partially/Not yet)
- Will AI be able to do this within 12-24 months?
- How well can AI do it compared to current solution?

### Step 3: Categorize Impact Areas
For each product capability, classify the AI impact as:

**Replacement**: AI can fully replace the current approach
- Example: AI bot answering customer questions instead of human support rep
- Action required: Fundamental product redesign
- Timeline: Urgent (0-12 months)

**Augmentation**: AI can enhance but not replace current approach
- Example: AI suggesting responses for support reps to use
- Action required: Feature integration
- Timeline: Important (6-18 months)

**Minimal Impact**: AI cannot meaningfully improve this area yet
- Example: Highly emotional or subjective interactions
- Action required: Monitor developments
- Timeline: Watch (18+ months)

### Step 4: Make the Strategic Commitment Decision
Based on your assessment, determine your strategic posture.

**All-In Indicators** (suggesting major strategic pivot):
- Core product function can be replaced by AI
- Industry expert (like Sam Altman) names your category as first to be disrupted
- Your product involves workflow automation, multimedia, or knowledge work
- Customer research shows strong demand for AI-powered alternatives

**Selective Integration Indicators**:
- AI can augment but not replace core functions
- Table stakes features are still dominant competitive factor
- Customer readiness is low or uncertain
- Core differentiation is non-AI related

**Key Question**: "If we don't go all-in on AI, will a newcomer with an AI-first approach make us irrelevant?"

If yes → This is a "before/after" moment requiring strategic pivot
If uncertain → Run time-boxed experiments to reduce uncertainty
If no → Integrate selectively while maintaining core strategy

### Step 5: Define Strategic Horizons
Use a horizon planning framework to balance near-term and long-term AI investments.

**Horizon 1 (0-18 months)**:
- What AI features can we ship now with proven value?
- What infrastructure do we need to build today?
- How do we maintain current business while transforming?

**Horizon 2 (18-36 months)**:
- What will AI be capable of that changes our roadmap?
- What organizational changes are needed?
- How might our business model need to evolve?

**Horizon 3 (36+ months)**:
- What if everything we're building now becomes irrelevant?
- What entirely new paradigms might emerge?
- How do we build optionality for radical change?

**Critical Balance**: Stay focused on Horizon 1 execution while maintaining awareness of Horizon 2-3 possibilities. Don't let long-term speculation paralyze near-term action.

### Step 6: Validate Through Market Research
Before committing resources, validate assumptions with customers.

- **Test AI capabilities**: Build minimal prototypes to test AI quality
- **Measure customer response**: Do customers trust AI for this job?
- **Assess organizational readiness**: Can customers adapt their teams/processes?
- **Identify blocking issues**: What prevents adoption even if tech works?

**Example from Intercom's Fin**:
- Built AI chatbot to replace first-line support
- Found customers were skeptical: "Is it as good as a person?"
- Discovered biggest challenge was organizational change, not technology
- Success metric: Some customers resolved 50-70% of queries with AI

### Step 7: Establish Decision Criteria
Create clear criteria for go/no-go on major AI investments.

**Technical Criteria**:
- AI can perform core task at X% accuracy
- Response time meets user expectations
- Solution works within acceptable cost structure

**Market Criteria**:
- Y% of target customers express strong interest
- Competitive advantage period of at least Z months
- Can acquire necessary ML/AI talent

**Business Criteria**:
- ROI positive within defined timeframe
- Risk acceptable relative to current business
- Aligned with company strengths and culture

## Expected Outcomes
- Clear strategic position on AI investment level (all-in, selective, monitor)
- Roadmap of specific AI features to build in priority order
- Understanding of replacement vs. augmentation opportunities
- Executive alignment on AI strategy
- Criteria for future AI investment decisions
- Risk mitigation plan for AI disruption

## Common Pitfalls

**Pitfall 1: Getting Distracted by Cool Technology**
- **Problem**: Building AI features because they're interesting, not because they solve customer problems
- **How to Avoid**: Always start with customer problems, not AI capabilities. Ask "Does this solve a problem customers have energy around?"

**Pitfall 2: Bolting On AI vs. Integrating Deeply**
- **Problem**: Creating an "AI team" separate from core product teams, leading to superficial integration
- **How to Avoid**: Integrate AI capabilities into all product teams. Make everyone learn AI, not just specialists. Avoid "the mobile team" mistake where important platform shifts are siloed.

**Pitfall 3: Over-Indexing on Hype Cycle Cynicism**
- **Problem**: Dismissing AI as "just another hype cycle like crypto/Web3" and moving too slowly
- **How to Avoid**: Recognize genuine technological inflection points. AI's ability to reason, write, analyze images represents fundamental capability shifts, unlike many previous hype cycles.

**Pitfall 4: Perfectionism Blocking Experimentation**
- **Problem**: Waiting for AI to be "perfect" before shipping, missing learning opportunities
- **How to Avoid**: Remember AI mistakes at human error rates are acceptable. Ship early to learn customer tolerance and expectations.

**Pitfall 5: Underestimating Organizational Change Requirements**
- **Problem**: Focusing purely on technology while ignoring how AI changes user roles and workflows
- **How to Avoid**: Plan for organizational change management. For customer support, new roles like "conversation designer" emerged. Anticipate similar shifts in your domain.

**Pitfall 6: Paralysis from Horizon 3 Uncertainty**
- **Problem**: Being unable to commit to Horizon 1 plans because Horizon 3 might make everything irrelevant
- **How to Avoid**: Accept ambiguity. Build for near-term while maintaining strategic optionality. The level of ambiguity is "off the charts" - this is normal.

## AI Integration Notes

### For AI Models Using This SOP

**Context Signals That Should Trigger This SOP**:
- User asks about AI strategy or whether to invest in AI
- User mentions competitors launching AI features
- User is in a category involving knowledge work, automation, or multimedia
- User asks how to evaluate emerging technology trends
- Discussion of major strategic decisions or roadmap planning

**How to Adapt for Different Situations**:
- **Early-stage startups**: Focus more on differentiation opportunity, less on protecting existing business
- **Enterprise products**: Weight organizational change challenges higher
- **Consumer products**: Consider if AI is table stakes vs. differentiation
- **Technical products**: Users may have higher AI sophistication and expectations

**Limitations and Edge Cases**:
- Framework assumes AI capabilities continue advancing - may need revision if progress plateaus
- Most applicable to products involving knowledge work, analysis, or content
- Less relevant for physical products, though AI may impact adjacent services
- Cultural/organizational factors may override pure strategic logic

**Key Principles to Emphasize**:
1. Always start with customer problems, not technology capabilities
2. This is likely an inflection point as significant as mobile or internet
3. "Adapt or die" is the mindset when AI can replace core functions
4. Balance urgency with learning - ship to learn, not ship perfect
5. Organizational change is often harder than technical implementation
