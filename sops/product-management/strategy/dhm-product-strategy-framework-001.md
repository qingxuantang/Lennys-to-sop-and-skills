- **Domain**: Product Management / Strategy
- **Type**: Framework SOP
- **Applicable To**: Product Managers, Product Leaders, Founders
- **Company Stage**: All stages
- **Difficulty**: Intermediate

## Overview
The DHM Framework provides a simple but powerful lens for evaluating product strategy: **Delight customers in Hard-to-copy, Margin-enhancing ways**. Every strategic initiative should be evaluated against these three dimensions. The key insight: if you can delight customers AND build competitive moats AND drive business outcomes, you've found a winning strategy.

## When to Use
- Evaluating new product initiatives
- Prioritizing features or projects
- Assessing competitive positioning
- Making investment decisions
- Building long-term product strategy
- Deciding whether to roll out A/B test winners

## Prerequisites
- Clear understanding of your customer
- Ability to measure customer delight (retention, NPS, engagement)
- Understanding of business model and margins
- Knowledge of competitive landscape

## Core Concept: The Three Dimensions

### D - Delight Customers
**Definition**: Create experiences that are 10X better than alternatives.

**Key questions:**
- Does this make customers measurably happier?
- Will it improve retention?
- Is this something customers actively want?
- Would customers notice if we removed it?

**How to measure:**
- Retention improvements
- NPS scores
- Usage metrics
- Customer satisfaction surveys

**Netflix example:**
- Perfect new release test: Would getting DVDs the next day delight customers enough to improve retention?
- Result: Very small retention improvement (4.5% → 4.45%)
- Learning: Customers said they wanted it, but behavior showed minimal impact

### H - Hard to Copy
**Definition**: Build sustainable competitive advantages that take years to replicate.

**Types of hard-to-copy advantages:**
1. **Brand**: Customer trust built over time
2. **Unique Technology**: Proprietary algorithms, patents
3. **Network Effects**: Value increases with more users
4. **Economies of Scale**: Cost advantages from size
5. **Switching Costs**: Pain of leaving (more common in B2B)
6. **Original Content**: Exclusive offerings

**Key questions:**
- Can competitors replicate this within a week?
- Does this build long-term defensibility?
- Are we creating something that compounds over time?

**Netflix examples:**
- Personalization: Knows movie tastes of billions of profiles
- Original content: Exclusive shows no one else can offer
- Brand: Trust with credit card for $20/month
- Scale: Can amortize $18B content budget across 220M members

### M - Margin Enhancing
**Definition**: Drives business outcomes (revenue, profit, efficiency).

**Key questions:**
- Does this improve retention (reduce churn)?
- Does this increase willingness to pay?
- Does this reduce costs?
- Does this help acquire customers more efficiently?

**The delight vs. margin tradeoff:**
- Maximum delight without margin = unsustainable business
- Maximum margin without delight = customers leave
- Goal: Find the right balance

## Procedure

### Step 1: Define the Hypothesis
Frame the initiative as a testable hypothesis:
> "[Feature/Initiative] will **delight** customers because [reason], build **hard-to-copy** advantage through [mechanism], and enhance **margin** by [business outcome].

**Example:**
> "Personalization will **delight** customers by helping them find movies they love, build **hard-to-copy** advantage through our unique taste data on billions of profiles, and enhance **margin** by right-sizing content investments."

### Step 2: Score Delight Potential
Estimate the delight impact:

**Questions to answer:**
- What percentage of customers will use this feature?
- How much will it improve their experience?
- Will it measurably improve retention?

**Two-percenter rule:**
- If only 2% of customers will use a feature, kill it
- Creates complexity for 98% who don't use it
- Engineers will forget about edge cases
- Regularly "scrape the barnacles" (remove low-usage features)

### Step 3: Assess Hard-to-Copy Advantage
Evaluate competitive moat potential:

| Advantage Type | Time to Replicate | Example |
|---------------|-------------------|---------|
| Brand | Years | Netflix trust |
| Network effects | Years | User-generated data |
| Unique tech | Months to years | Personalization algorithm |
| Scale | Years | Content budget |
| Easy to copy | Days to weeks | Happy family on landing page |

**Key insight**: If competitors can copy it within a week, the advantage is temporary.

### Step 4: Calculate Margin Impact
Model the business case:

**Retention example (Netflix DVD test):**
1. Calculate customers retained: 5,000
2. Multiply by lifetime value: $100
3. Apply word-of-mouth factor: 2X
4. Total value: $1 million

**Compare to cost:**
- Cost of implementation: $5 million
- Net impact: -$4 million

**Decision**: Don't roll out (unless you believe word-of-mouth is higher)

### Step 5: Evaluate the Tradeoffs
Consider all three dimensions together:

| Scenario | D | H | M | Decision |
|----------|---|---|---|----------|
| High delight, easy to copy, low margin | ✓ | ✗ | ✗ | Skip |
| Low delight, hard to copy, high margin | ✗ | ✓ | ✓ | Consider |
| High delight, hard to copy, low margin | ✓ | ✓ | ✗ | Invest cautiously |
| High delight, hard to copy, high margin | ✓ | ✓ | ✓ | Invest heavily |

### Step 6: Test and Learn
Run experiments to validate hypotheses:

**A/B test structure:**
- Test cell: Gets the new experience
- Control: Gets current experience
- Measure: Retention, engagement, conversion

**Accept failed hypotheses:**
- Netflix tried social features twice (Friends, Xbox Party) - both failed
- Failed hypotheses teach you about your customers
- Expect 6 of 10 ideas to fail

## Application Examples

### Case 1: Netflix Party (Watch Together)
**Hypothesis**: Netflix Party will delight customers, build network effects, and improve retention.

**Analysis:**
- D (Delight): Fun during COVID, but niche appeal
- H (Hard to copy): Would build network effects
- M (Margin): Only valuable if enough people use it

**Result**: Estimated only ~5% would use it (two-percenter territory)
**Decision**: Not enough usage to drive retention improvement

### Case 2: Auto-Cancel Inactive Members
**Hypothesis**: Auto-canceling inactive members will build brand trust.

**Analysis:**
- D (Delight): Very delightful (giving money back!)
- H (Hard to copy): Builds brand trust over time
- M (Margin): Loses ~$100M revenue

**Decision framework:**
- Is it high stakes or low stakes?
- Magnitude: $100M vs $30B revenue = small
- Reversibility: Can restart the practice anytime
- Result: Low stakes, worth doing for brand

### Case 3: Ad-Supported Plan
**Hypothesis**: A lower-priced ad tier will attract new customers.

**Analysis:**
- D (Delight): Choice can be delightful for price-sensitive customers
- H (Hard to copy): Builds economies of scale with more members
- M (Margin): Incremental revenue from new customer segment

**Key insight**: Customer choice can outweigh complexity of ads.

## Expected Outcomes
- Clear strategic prioritization
- Fewer "shiny object" distractions
- Better resource allocation
- Long-term competitive advantage
- Sustainable business growth

## Common Pitfalls

### Building easy-to-copy features
- Happy family on landing page = copied within a week
- Pretty UI = temporary advantage
- Focus on harder-to-build advantages

### Ignoring the two-percenter rule
- Features for 2% create complexity for 98%
- Regularly audit feature usage
- "Scrape the barnacles" periodically

### Overweighting what customers say
- Customers said they wanted new releases faster
- But behavior showed minimal retention impact
- Always validate with data, not just surveys

### Neglecting margin in pursuit of delight
- Maximum delight ≠ good business
- Must balance customer value with business value
- The tradeoff is the strategy

## AI Integration Notes

### Context signals that should trigger this SOP:
- User mentions "product strategy," "competitive advantage"
- Questions about feature prioritization
- Discussions about moats and defensibility
- Evaluating whether to build something

### How to apply:
- Use DHM as a lens for any strategic decision
- Emphasize the hard-to-copy dimension (often overlooked)
- Help identify two-percenters to avoid
- Calculate margin impact explicitly

### Key insight:
Most teams focus only on Delight. The DHM framework forces consideration of competitive advantage and business viability.
