# Execution Over Strategy Framework

## Metadata
- **Source**: Ami Vora - Lenny's Podcast
- **Domain**: Product Management / Strategy
- **Type**: Framework SOP
- **Applicable To**: Product Managers, Product Leaders, Founders
- **Company Stage**: All stages
- **Difficulty**: Beginner to Intermediate

## Overview
Product managers often over-index on strategy at the expense of execution. The reality: **for most products, it's about 20% strategy and 80% execution**. Great strategy with poor execution loses to good strategy with great execution. The key insight: **ruthless prioritization, not clever strategy, is usually the bottleneck**.

## When to Use
- Feeling overwhelmed by competing priorities
- Team struggling to ship
- Analysis paralysis on direction
- Strategy vs. execution debates
- Coaching PMs on focus

## Prerequisites
- Existing strategic direction (even imperfect)
- Team capable of executing
- Understanding of what "good" execution looks like
- Willingness to make hard prioritization calls

## Core Concept: The 20/80 Split

### Strategy vs. Execution Reality
Most product advice focuses on strategy, but execution is where products succeed or fail.

**Common misconception:**
- "If we just find the right strategy, success will follow"
- "We need to keep iterating on our approach"
- "Let's get alignment before we execute"

**Reality:**
- Strategy matters, but it's table stakes
- Execution quality determines outcomes
- Most strategic options are roughly equivalent
- Execution separates winners from losers

**The ratio:**
> "In my experience, success is roughly 20% strategy, 80% execution. Most teams have the strategy part roughly right. They fail on execution."

### What Execution Actually Means

**Execution is NOT:**
- Just shipping code faster
- Working longer hours
- Cutting quality corners
- Ignoring strategy entirely

**Execution IS:**
- Ruthless prioritization
- Saying no to good things
- Sequencing work effectively
- Removing obstacles relentlessly
- Maintaining quality bar
- Shipping AND learning

## Procedure

### Step 1: Validate Strategy is "Good Enough"
Don't over-invest in strategy perfection.

**Good enough strategy:**
- Clear target customer
- Understood value proposition
- Reasonable competitive position
- Plausible path to success
- Team believes in it

**Strategy red flags (need more work):**
- No clear target customer
- Confused value proposition
- No competitive insight
- Team doesn't believe in it

**Key insight:**
> "If you've spent more than a month on strategy without shipping, you've probably over-invested. Get to good enough and execute."

**Threshold test:**
Ask: "If we execute perfectly on this strategy, could we succeed?"
- Yes → Execute
- No → Refine strategy (but set a deadline)

### Step 2: Ruthless Prioritization
The core execution skill is saying no.

**Prioritization principles:**
1. **One thing at a time**: Focus team energy
2. **Finish before starting**: Complete current work
3. **Sequence, don't parallel**: Fewer balls in air
4. **Kill zombies**: End projects going nowhere
5. **Protect the team**: Shield from distractions

**The priority stack:**
| Priority Level | What Belongs Here |
|----------------|-------------------|
| P0 | Must do this quarter to succeed |
| P1 | Important but can wait |
| P2 | Nice to have |
| P3 | Probably never |

**Key insight:**
> "If everything is priority, nothing is. Your P0 list should have 2-3 things, not 10."

### Step 3: Create Execution Focus
Structure team for execution, not strategy work.

**Execution-focused team structure:**
- Clear ownership (one owner per initiative)
- Dedicated time (no context switching)
- Short cycles (weekly shipping, not quarterly)
- Fast feedback (metrics within days)

**Weekly execution rhythm:**
| Day | Focus |
|-----|-------|
| Monday | Review last week, plan this week |
| Tue-Thu | Deep work on P0 priorities |
| Friday | Ship something, review progress |

**Remove execution blockers:**
- Unclear decisions → Make them
- Missing resources → Get them or descope
- Cross-team dependencies → Resolve or remove
- Process overhead → Eliminate it

### Step 4: Ship and Learn
Execution includes learning, not just shipping.

**Ship-learn cycle:**
1. Ship smallest valuable increment
2. Measure impact immediately
3. Learn from results
4. Adjust execution (rarely strategy)
5. Ship next increment

**Learning questions:**
- Did it work? (metrics)
- Why or why not? (analysis)
- What's the next action? (execution)

**What NOT to do:**
- Ship without measuring
- Learn without adjusting
- Adjust strategy with every result
- Wait for perfect before shipping

### Step 5: Maintain Quality Bar
Execution doesn't mean cutting corners.

**Quality in execution:**
- Ship less, but ship it well
- Quality speeds up overall progress
- Technical debt slows future execution
- User trust requires consistency

**Quality checklist before shipping:**
- Does it solve the core problem?
- Is it reliable/stable?
- Does it meet the bar for this product?
- Would we be proud to show it?

**Trade-off:**
> "It's not 'should we have quality?' It's 'how much scope can we cut while maintaining quality?'"

### Step 6: Resist Strategy Drift
Stay the course long enough to see results.

**Strategy drift symptoms:**
- Changing direction with each data point
- New strategy every quarter
- Never seeing initiatives through
- Team whiplash

**When to actually change strategy:**
- Fundamental assumption proven wrong
- Market shifted dramatically
- Multiple execution attempts failed
- New information changes everything

**When to stay the course:**
- Early results are mixed (normal)
- Team is struggling (often execution issue)
- Competitors doing something different (often fine)
- Executives questioning (have the conversation)

## Expected Outcomes
- More shipped product
- Faster learning cycles
- Better team morale
- Clearer priorities
- Improved results

## Common Pitfalls

### Over-strategizing
- Strategy decks every quarter
- Waiting for perfect alignment
- Analysis paralysis
- "We need more research"

### Under-prioritizing
- Everything is P0
- Can't say no
- Team spread too thin
- Nothing ships

### Mistaking motion for execution
- Many meetings = progress
- Busy = productive
- Working on it = getting it done
- Planning counts as executing

### Abandoning strategy too early
- New strategy every month
- Insufficient time to learn
- Constant pivots
- Never proving anything

### Cutting quality for speed
- Shipping broken things
- Accumulating tech debt
- User trust eroding
- Slower long-term execution

- Team Focus Management
- Shipping Cadence

## AI Integration Notes

### Context signals that should trigger this SOP:
- "We keep debating strategy"
- "Team isn't shipping"
- "Too many priorities"
- "Should we pivot?"

### How to apply:
- Help validate strategy is "good enough"
- Assist with ruthless prioritization
- Structure execution focus
- Distinguish execution from strategy problems

### Key insight:
Most product problems are execution problems, not strategy problems. The PM who ships good work on a decent strategy beats the PM with perfect strategy who can't execute. Focus 80% of your energy on making the current strategy work through great execution.
