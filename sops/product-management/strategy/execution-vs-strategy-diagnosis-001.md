## Overview
Most execution problems are actually strategy problems, interpersonal problems, or cultural problems in disguise. The key insight: **if you keep applying bandaids to "execution issues" and they keep reappearing, you're probably treating the symptom, not the disease**.

## When to Use
- Recurring execution issues
- Teams that can't align
- "Same problem, different quarter"
- Misalignment despite many meetings
- Bandaids that keep falling off

## Prerequisites
- Honest assessment capability
- Willingness to examine root causes
- Access to leadership for strategy/culture issues
- Organizational memory (tracking past fixes)

## Core Concept: The Misdiagnosis Problem

### What Looks Like Execution Problems
- Teams can't align
- Dates keep slipping
- Dependencies aren't met
- Projects stall
- Too much firefighting

### What They Often Actually Are

**Strategy Problems:**
- No clear priorities
- Conflicting OKRs
- Unclear direction
- Don't know what to do when reality changes

**Interpersonal Problems:**
- Two leaders can't get along
- Trust is broken
- Historical conflicts
- Communication styles clash

**Culture Problems:**
- OKR optimization over company outcomes
- No incentive to help other teams
- Wrist-slapping for missed team goals
- Credit-taking culture

## Procedure

### Step 1: Document the Bandaids
Track what "fixes" have been tried.

**Common bandaids:**
- New meeting created
- New review process added
- Managers asked to sync more
- New Slack channel
- Additional documentation
- Cross-team ritual added

**Questions to ask:**
- What have we tried to fix this?
- When did we try it?
- Did it work? For how long?
- Is the problem back?

### Step 2: Check for Pattern Recurrence
The bandaid falling off is the signal.

**Signs of symptom treatment:**
- Same problem, new quarter
- "We've solved this before"
- Déjà vu in planning
- Short organizational memory

**Tracking template:**
| Problem | Bandaid Applied | Date | Status After 3 Months |
|---------|-----------------|------|----------------------|
| Team X and Y misaligned | Monthly sync meeting | Q1 | Problem persists |
| Team X and Y misaligned | Shared OKR added | Q2 | Problem persists |

If the problem persists after multiple bandaids, it's not an execution problem.

### Step 3: Diagnose Strategy Problems
Check if unclear strategy is the root cause.

**Strategy problem indicators:**
- Different teams pursuing different strategies
- No one can articulate the overall strategy
- OKRs aren't aligned with each other
- Teams don't know what to do when priorities conflict
- "We're aligned" but behaviors diverge

**Questions to ask:**
- Can everyone state our strategy in one sentence?
- Do teams know what to deprioritize?
- When two priorities conflict, who decides?
- What happens when reality changes mid-quarter?

**Example:**
> Two teams are misaligned. You create a sync meeting. Meeting happens weekly. Teams still struggle to collaborate. The sync becomes a forum for arguing minutiae.
>
> **Root cause:** There's no clear strategy telling both teams what matters most. They're each optimizing for their own goals because there's no shared direction.

### Step 4: Diagnose Interpersonal Problems
Check if people issues are the root cause.

**Interpersonal problem indicators:**
- Two specific people are always in conflict
- Problem follows specific individuals, not roles
- Passive-aggressive communication
- Historical grudges
- "I just can't work with them"

**Questions to ask:**
- Is this problem between specific people?
- Does the problem persist when one person is out?
- Has there been a trust-breaking event?
- Would swapping one person change the dynamic?

**Example:**
> Two team managers constantly clash. You create process to reduce friction. Friction continues. The problem isn't the process — these two people fundamentally don't trust each other.
>
> **Root cause:** Interpersonal conflict that no amount of process will fix. Need coaching, mediation, or organizational change.

### Step 5: Diagnose Culture Problems
Check if cultural incentives are the root cause.

**Culture problem indicators:**
- Teams optimizing for their OKRs at company expense
- Helping other teams is punished (missed own goals)
- Credit-taking over collaboration
- Managers getting "wrist-slapped" for team collaboration

**Questions to ask:**
- What gets rewarded here?
- What happens when a team misses OKRs to help another team?
- How is collaboration recognized?
- Do leaders model cross-team support?

**Example:**
> Team A should help Team B, but doesn't. You create a shared OKR. Team A still prioritizes their own work. Manager of Team A got criticized last quarter for missing goals.
>
> **Root cause:** Culture says "hit your OKRs" above all else. No process will fix this until the cultural incentive changes.

### Step 6: Apply Root Cause Fixes

**For strategy problems:**
- Clarify and communicate strategy
- Align OKRs to strategy (not just to each other)
- Create explicit prioritization framework
- Define decision rights when conflicts arise

**For interpersonal problems:**
- Direct coaching of individuals
- Mediation between parties
- Role changes if necessary
- Clear expectations setting

**For culture problems:**
- Change what gets rewarded
- Model desired behavior from top
- Redefine success metrics
- Celebrate cross-team collaboration publicly

### Step 7: Track the Fix
Verify the root cause was addressed.

**Success indicators:**
- Problem doesn't recur
- Teams naturally collaborate
- Bandaid processes can be removed
- Energy goes to work, not alignment

**3-month check:**
- Is the problem still present?
- Have we needed new bandaids?
- Has behavior actually changed?

## True Execution Problems

**Genuine execution problems do exist:**
- Skills gap (wrong person for the role)
- Infrastructure limitations
- Resource constraints
- Technical debt
- Process gaps (first time doing something)

**How to identify true execution problems:**
- Problem is new (not recurring)
- Clear cause (not mysterious)
- One bandaid fixes it
- Doesn't depend on relationships or strategy

## Expected Outcomes
- Fewer recurring problems
- More effective interventions
- Less process overhead
- Better organizational health
- Faster problem resolution

## Common Pitfalls

### Preferring bandaids because they're easier
- Root cause fixes require harder conversations
- Strategy problems require leadership involvement
- Culture problems require systemic change
- Bandaids feel like action

### Short organizational memory
- "We solved this last quarter" (actually we didn't)
- Not tracking what was tried
- Repeating the same fixes
- No institutional learning

### Blaming individuals for systemic issues
- "Team X just needs to execute better"
- Ignoring structural causes
- Expecting heroes to overcome bad systems
- Not seeing the forest for the trees

### Avoiding interpersonal issues
- Hoping process will fix people problems
- Not having the hard conversation
- Letting conflicts fester
- Optimistic denial

## AI Integration Notes

### Context signals that should trigger this SOP:
- "Teams can't align"
- "Same problem keeps happening"
- "We've tried everything"
- "Execution issues despite good people"

### How to apply:
- Help track bandaids tried
- Ask diagnostic questions for each root cause
- Push toward root cause, not symptoms
- Suggest appropriate intervention level

### Key insight:
In high-performing organizations with good intentions, recurring execution problems are almost never execution problems. They're strategy, interpersonal, or culture problems wearing execution problem masks.
