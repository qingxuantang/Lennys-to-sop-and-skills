- **Applicable To**: Product leaders working on legacy/declining products, turnaround situations
- **Difficulty**: Advanced

## Overview
A systematic approach to transforming underperforming or negatively perceived platform products ("minus one to one") at scale companies. This framework addresses the unique challenges of changing entrenched processes, metrics, and perceptions while maintaining business continuity.

## When to Use
- Product has negative market perception despite large user base
- Internal teams treat the product as a utility (traffic source) rather than destination
- Product has entrenched flows, processes, and metrics preventing innovation
- Product team doesn't exist or is deprioritized ("nobody cared about it")
- Need to fundamentally change product DNA while keeping site operational
- Product serves as platform for other teams, creating conflicting incentives

## Prerequisites
- Clarity on the product's true potential and purpose
- Executive support for experimentation (even if not full transformation)
- Ability to carve out resources (people and user cohort)
- Understanding of why product is currently failing
- Metrics infrastructure to track new success criteria
- Patience for 6-12 month transformation timeline

## Procedure

### Step 1: Establish the Mountain Peak Vision
**Objective**: Define the true potential, not current state

**Process**:
1. Start from "what could this be?" not "what is this?"
2. Look at total addressable market, not current usage
3. Ask: "If successful, what change would happen in the world?"
4. Make the peak specific and visualizable:
   - Not just "a mountain" but "see the peak, base camp, and path"
   - Specific numbers (e.g., "daily use by millions, not tens of millions")
   - Clear user behavior changes
5. Work backwards from the vision

**LinkedIn Feed Example**:
- Vision: "Platform for knowledge exchange and professional community"
- Not: "Activity feed" or "traffic source for other products"
- Target: Professionals coming daily to learn and share expertise
- Not limited by: Current user numbers or engagement

**Key Mindset**: "I don't start building from the numbers today. I start from what this could be."

### Step 2: Reset the Product Purpose
**Objective**: Clearly articulate what the product is NOT, and what it IS

**Anti-Pattern Definition** (What It's NOT):
- Not a springboard for other products
- Not a traffic jumpstart
- Not an upsell feed
- Not promotional in nature

**New Purpose** (What It IS):
- Specific value proposition
- Clear audience definition
- Unique criteria for success

**LinkedIn Feed Example**:
- IS: "People that matter, talking about things I care about professionally"
- IS: Knowledge exchange
- IS: Right views for right experts to build reputation and business
- NOT: Activity tracking feed

**Output**: One-sentence purpose statement that everyone can recite

### Step 3: Assemble a Dedicated Team
**Objective**: Create ownership and focus

**Team Structure**:
- Dedicated PM (not shared, not part-time)
- Unified team with clear charter
- Not borrowed resources from other teams
- Bring together previously separated functions (e.g., AI + Product)
- Give PM authority to make decisions

**Key Action**: "I asked to do this role, nobody cared about it. I really believed in it."

**Team Charter**:
- Own the mountain peak vision
- Empowered to experiment
- Not responsible for other teams' metrics (initially)
- Clear success criteria aligned to new purpose

### Step 4: Identify the Internal Resistance Pattern
**Objective**: Understand why previous attempts failed

**Common Internal Obstacles**:
1. **Metric Dependencies**: Other teams rely on product for their goals
2. **Entrenched Processes**: Years of workflows that resist change
3. **Conflicting Objectives**: Product serves multiple masters
4. **Resource Competition**: Shared resources prioritize other work
5. **Cultural Inertia**: "This is how we've always done it"

**LinkedIn Feed Example**:
- Every team used feed for traffic to their features
- Any experiment scared the whole system
- Teams freaked out about meeting their goals
- Spent all time on escalations, not building

**Diagnostic Questions**:
- Who depends on this product for their metrics?
- What processes are tied to current product behavior?
- Where do escalations come from when you try to change things?
- What resources are shared vs. dedicated?

### Step 5: Carve Out a Protected Cohort
**Objective**: Create space to prove the new model without breaking the system

**Cohort Strategy**:
- Select size that's meaningful but not disruptive (e.g., 2M out of 100M+ members)
- Randomized selection
- Remove from other teams' metric dependencies (or make small enough not to matter)
- Give yourself "full liberty" to experiment
- Commit to this for months, not weeks
- Treat as "your members" - a country unto itself

**What This Enables**:
- Avoid escalation fatigue
- Prove dramatic behavior change is possible
- Create concrete evidence for org-wide rollout
- Build without constant political battles

**Key Principle**: "I realized I was spending my time in escalations instead of building a great product."

### Step 6: Change the Core Engine
**Objective**: Transform the product's fundamental mechanics

**For AI-Powered Products**:
1. Unify AI team with product team (see AI-First SOP)
2. Shift algorithm objectives to new purpose
3. Invest in new algorithm features and data training
4. Change what you optimize for

**LinkedIn Feed Example**:
- Shifted from click-through to downstream conversations
- Added professional relevance signals
- Trained on knowledge-sharing examples
- Removed spam and promotional content actively

**For Other Products**:
- Identify the "engine" that drives outcomes
- Redesign around new purpose
- May involve infrastructure changes
- Often requires new technical capabilities

### Step 7: Run Proof-of-Concept Tests
**Objective**: Build evidence that new approach works

**Test Types**:
1. **Positive Tests**: Show new experience performs better
2. **Negative Tests**: Prove old approach would fail organically
3. **A/B Tests**: Compare old vs. new directly
4. **Cohort Comparison**: Protected group vs. control

**Timeline**: Expect months of testing before clear signal

**LinkedIn Feed Example**:
- Ran negative tests showing promotional feed would decay
- Showed randomized cohort had dramatically different behavior
- Proved could "grow the pie" not just reallocate it

**Success Criteria**:
- Behavior change in protected cohort
- Metrics aligned to new purpose improving
- Evidence strong enough to overcome skepticism

### Step 8: Build Internal Proof Points
**Objective**: Create believers inside the organization

**Tactics**:
- Share cohort results widely
- Show specific examples of new behavior
- Demonstrate new possibilities
- Connect to company mission/values
- Address fears directly with data

**Narrative Shift**:
- From: "This is breaking our metrics"
- To: "This is unlocking new growth"
- From: "Risky experiment"
- To: "Proven model ready to scale"

### Step 9: Expand to Full Product
**Objective**: Scale the transformation organization-wide

**Rollout Process**:
1. Announce results from protected cohort
2. Address concerns from dependent teams
3. Show how new model benefits everyone
4. Staged rollout with monitoring
5. Adjust based on feedback
6. Full commitment once proven

**Key Consideration**: Don't rush this. Better to over-prove than under-prove.

### Step 10: Continuously Evolve Purpose
**Objective**: Keep product relevant and improving

**Ongoing Work**:
- Refine algorithm objectives
- Add new capabilities aligned to purpose
- Remove bad actors/content that violates purpose
- Listen to creator and consumer feedback
- Adjust to market changes

**LinkedIn Feed Example**:
- Added video for creators
- Built coaching features for value exchange
- Continued spam removal investments
- Optimized for "right views" not volume

## Expected Outcomes
- Product transforms from neglected to strategic priority
- User behavior fundamentally changes (daily use, engagement quality)
- Team morale and recruitment improves ("wow, we have this cohort doing extremely well")
- Internal perception shifts from cost center to growth driver
- Market perception transforms over 12-24 months
- Product becomes competitive advantage

**Timeframe**: 6-18 months for full transformation

## Common Pitfalls

### Pitfall 1: Working on Overall Experience Too Long
**Problem**: Trying to transform entire product at once leads to constant escalations
**Solution**: Carve out protected cohort early (within first few months of trying)

### Pitfall 2: Unclear New Purpose
**Problem**: Can't articulate what product should be, only what it shouldn't be
**Solution**: Invest weeks in purpose definition before execution

### Pitfall 3: Insufficient Authority
**Problem**: Team can't make decisions without constant approval
**Solution**: Ensure dedicated PM/leader has real authority over protected cohort

### Pitfall 4: Premature Organization-Wide Rollout
**Problem**: Expanding before proof is overwhelming
**Solution**: Stay with cohort until results are undeniable (months, not weeks)

### Pitfall 5: Ignoring Internal Incentives
**Problem**: Other teams still optimize against your product
**Solution**: Work with leadership to adjust incentive structures

### Pitfall 6: Accepting Current State as Ceiling
**Problem**: Setting goals based on current metrics rather than potential
**Solution**: Always start from "what could this be?" and work backwards

### Pitfall 7: No Dedicated Team
**Problem**: Relying on borrowed resources or shared attention
**Solution**: Create dedicated team early, even if small

### Pitfall 8: Changing Metrics Without Changing Product
**Problem**: Just reporting different numbers without product changes
**Solution**: Actually transform the core engine (algorithm, experience, etc.)

## Real-World Example: LinkedIn Feed (2013-2016)

### Initial State
- First company to have social feed
- Started wrong: activity feed (who changed what, who connected to who)
- Promotional in nature
- Used by other teams as traffic source
- No dedicated feed team or PM
- Negative perception: "cringey place to promote yourself"

### Transformation Process
1. **Vision**: Daily knowledge-sharing platform for professionals
2. **Team**: Tomer asked to lead, assembled dedicated team
3. **Purpose Reset**: Knowledge exchange, not promotion
4. **AI-First**: Unified AI team with Feed team
5. **Cohort**: Carved out 2M members
6. **Engine Change**: New algorithm objectives focused on quality conversations
7. **Proof**: Months of testing showed dramatic behavior change
8. **Rollout**: Expanded to all members with proven model
9. **Evolution**: Continued improvements (video, coaching, spam removal)

### Results
- Multi-day active user product
- Major traffic source for Lenny's Newsletter and other creators
- Transformed perception: professional knowledge hub
- Created LinkedIn creator economy
- "Absurdly underappreciated turnaround"

### Timeline
- Started: ~2013-2014
- Protected cohort: ~6-12 months
- Full rollout: 2015-2016
- Ongoing evolution: 2016-present

## AI Integration Notes

### Context Signals That Should Trigger This SOP
- Product described as "minus one" or having negative perception
- Questions about "turning around" a product
- Large user base but declining engagement
- Legacy products with entrenched processes
- Products that serve as utilities for other teams
- Situations where "nobody cares about" the product despite potential

### How to Adapt for Different Situations

**For Smaller Companies (10-100 people)**:
- May not need protected cohort (can move whole product faster)
- Less organizational resistance but less resources
- Focus on Steps 1-2, 6 (Vision, Purpose, Engine Change)
- Can skip Step 5 if political dynamics are simpler

**For B2B vs B2C**:
- B2B: Longer sales cycles mean slower proof points
- B2C: Can see behavior change faster
- B2B: May need customer advisory board for validation
- B2C: Can rely more on quantitative metrics

**For Different Product Types**:
- Marketplace: Focus on value exchange both sides
- Platform: Focus on ecosystem health
- SaaS: Focus on workflow integration
- Consumer: Focus on daily habit formation

### Limitations and Edge Cases
- Requires minimum user base to carve out meaningful cohort (1M+ ideal)
- Not applicable to brand-new products (that's 0-to-1, not minus-1-to-1)
- Assumes product has underlying potential (not every product should exist)
- Needs executive patience (if CEO demands results in weeks, won't work)
- Some products may be too broken to save (know when to sunset)

### Signs of Success
- Protected cohort shows 2-3x improvement in key metrics
- Internal skeptics start asking questions out of curiosity, not criticism
- Team recruiting improves (people want to join)
- Other PMs want to learn from your approach
- Market perception starts shifting (externally visible)

### Warning Signs of Failure
- After 6 months, no behavioral difference in cohort
- Constant escalations continue despite protected cohort
- Team turnover increases
- Can't articulate clear purpose after months
- Leadership losing patience or support
- Proof-of-concept results are marginal, not dramatic
