# Product Strategy Stack Framework

## Metadata
- **Source**: Ravi Mehta - Lenny's Podcast
- **Domain**: Product Management / Strategy
- **Type**: Framework SOP
- **Applicable To**: Product Managers, Product Leaders, Founders
- **Company Stage**: All stages
- **Difficulty**: Intermediate

## Overview
The Product Strategy Stack separates normally conflated terms (goals, roadmap, strategy, mission) into clearly defined parts that work as a system. The key insight: **if a PM can't decide between option A and B, the root cause is almost always a gap in understanding strategy, not a gap in prioritization skill**.

## When to Use
- Defining product direction
- Debugging prioritization issues
- Aligning teams on strategy
- New PM onboarding
- Strategy reviews and planning
- When goals aren't being met

## Prerequisites
- Access to company mission/strategy
- Cross-functional stakeholder input
- Time for strategic thinking
- Design support for visual strategy

## Core Concept: The Five Layers

### Layer 1: Company Mission
**Definition**: The change the company wants to bring to the world.

**Characteristics:**
- Qualitative and aspirational
- Defines the company's purpose
- Guides long-term direction
- Includes vision of the future

**Examples:**
- Tinder: "Make single life more fun"
- Hinge: "Designed to be deleted"
- Slack: "Make work life simpler, more pleasant, and more productive"

### Layer 2: Company Strategy
**Definition**: The logical plan to bring the mission into being.

**Characteristics:**
- Rigorously logical (not aspirational)
- Specific and concrete
- Includes business model, go-to-market
- Defines how the company will win

**Components:**
- Target market
- Value proposition
- Business model
- Competitive positioning
- Key capabilities

### Layer 3: Product Strategy
**Definition**: The connective tissue between company strategy and day-to-day product work.

**Characteristics:**
- Translates strategy to product decisions
- Defines what the product will be
- Includes visual representation (wireframes)
- Guides feature prioritization

**Key insight:**
> "Strategy docs aren't complete without wireframes. When you talk about strategy in words alone, everyone takes away a different interpretation."

### Layer 4: Product Roadmap
**Definition**: The sequence of product work to fulfill the strategy.

**Characteristics:**
- Time-bound initiatives
- Prioritized by strategic impact
- Balances short and long term
- Communicates what's coming

### Layer 5: Product Goals
**Definition**: The measurable outcomes that indicate progress.

**Characteristics:**
- Quantifiable metrics
- Track strategy execution
- Come AFTER roadmap (contrarian view)
- Validate strategic direction

## Procedure

### Step 1: Start with Company Mission
Ensure clarity on the overarching purpose.

**Questions to answer:**
- What change do we want to bring to the world?
- What does success look like long-term?
- What is our unique purpose?

**Test:** Can everyone in the company articulate this?

### Step 2: Define Company Strategy
Create the logical plan to achieve the mission.

**Questions to answer:**
- Who are we targeting?
- What value do we provide?
- How do we make money?
- How do we beat competition?
- What capabilities do we need?

### Step 3: Translate to Product Strategy
Bridge company strategy to product decisions.

**Process:**
1. Identify product's role in company strategy
2. Define what the product needs to be
3. Create visual wireframes (not just words)
4. Specify trade-offs and constraints

**Why wireframes matter:**
> "It's like working with an architect. You would never work with an architect that didn't provide you a blueprint. Describing a house in words alone leads to different interpretations."

**Practical tip:**
> "A lot of mobile apps can only have four or five things on their nav bar. What are the four or five things? If you just describe your strategy in words, people might come up with one nav bar that's completely different than another."

### Step 4: Build the Roadmap
Sequence product work to fulfill strategy.

**Process:**
1. Generate candidate initiatives
2. Map each to product strategy
3. Prioritize by strategic alignment + impact
4. Sequence with dependencies
5. Communicate broadly

**Key insight:** Roadmap flows FROM strategy, not toward arbitrary goals.

### Step 5: Set Goals
Measure progress on strategy execution.

**Why goals come last:**
> "Taking a road trip and starting by saying 'we need to drive 250 miles' is backwards. You first decide where you want to drive to. Vegas is 250 miles from LA — the goal is in context of a destination."

**Benefits of goals after roadmap:**
- Goals measure strategy progress
- Avoids goal-chasing without direction
- Creates check on strategic direction
- Enables "leave gain on the table" conversations

### Step 6: Debug Bottom-Up
When things aren't working, work up the stack.

**Debugging process:**
| If... | Check... |
|-------|----------|
| Goals not being met | Is roadmap aligned? |
| Roadmap isn't working | Is product strategy clear? |
| Product strategy unclear | Do we understand company strategy? |
| Company strategy unclear | Is mission well-defined? |

**Example:**
> "When PMs can't decide between doing A or B, what it came down to was there wasn't a deep enough understanding of what the strategy is."

## Application Example: Tinder vs Hinge

**Mission:**
- Tinder: "Make single life more fun" (continuous use case)
- Hinge: "Designed to be deleted" (temporary use case)

**Strategy implications:**
- Tinder: Lightweight, serendipitous, entertainment
- Hinge: Deep profiles, prompts, relationship focus

**Product strategy:**
- Tinder: Fast swiping, easy matching, minimal friction
- Hinge: Profile prompts, slower evaluation, conversation starters

**Roadmap differences:**
- Tinder: Resisted adding filters (keeps serendipity)
- Hinge: Deep filtering and matching

**Goals:**
- Both: Meaningful conversations
- Different: Specific mechanics to drive them

## Expected Outcomes
- Clear prioritization criteria
- Aligned teams
- Coherent product direction
- Faster decision-making
- Better strategic debugging

## Common Pitfalls

### Starting with goals
- "Increase retention 10%"
- No context for what success looks like
- Chasing metrics without direction
- Goals should measure strategy, not drive it

### Strategy in words only
- Different interpretations
- Misaligned execution
- Debates at implementation time
- Include wireframes and visuals

### Conflating the layers
- Mission = Strategy = Goals
- Everything is "strategy"
- No clear hierarchy
- Define each layer distinctly

### Skipping the product strategy layer
- Company strategy → Roadmap directly
- No connective tissue
- PMs don't know how to prioritize
- Product strategy bridges the gap

## Related SOPs
- Goal Setting with NCTs
- Product Vision Documentation
- Roadmap Communication

## AI Integration Notes

### Context signals that should trigger this SOP:
- "I can't decide between A and B"
- Prioritization challenges
- Strategy alignment questions
- "What should we build?"

### How to apply:
- Identify which layer is unclear
- Work top-down for definition
- Work bottom-up for debugging
- Emphasize visual strategy documentation

### Key insight:
Most prioritization problems are strategy problems in disguise. If you can't decide between two options, the answer isn't better prioritization — it's clearer strategy.
