## Overview
A framework for structuring and scaling product teams in AI-driven organizations, emphasizing PM-light organizations, high-agency contributors, integrated research-product collaboration, and bottoms-up execution in rapidly evolving technology environments.

## When to Use
- Scaling product teams at AI or ML-focused companies
- Transitioning from research-heavy to product-focused organization
- Operating in environments where technology changes every 2-3 months
- Building teams that need to move extremely fast with high ambiguity
- Integrating research and product functions effectively

## Prerequisites
- Organization has strong engineering talent
- Access to research or ML capabilities (internal or external)
- Commitment to moving fast and tolerating mistakes
- Leadership buy-in for bottoms-up culture

## Procedure

### Step 1: Adopt a PM-Light Philosophy
Intentionally limit the number of product managers relative to engineers.
- Target ratio: ~1 PM per 6-8+ engineers (deliberately "too many" engineers per PM)
- Total PM count guideline: Keep PM team small relative to company size
  - Example: OpenAI has ~25 PMs despite being a major tech company
- Benefits of this approach:
  - Prevents "deck culture" and over-documentation
  - Forces PMs to focus on high-leverage decisions, not micromanagement
  - Empowers engineers to make more product decisions
  - Increases execution velocity

**Kevin's Principle:** "Too many PMs causes problems. We'll fill the world with decks and ideas versus execution."

### Step 2: Hire for High Agency and Ambiguity Tolerance
Recruit PMs who thrive in undefined, rapidly changing environments.

**Essential PM Characteristics:**
- **High Agency**: Don't wait for permission; see problems and solve them immediately
- **Ambiguity Comfort**: Can operate without clear direction or well-defined problems
- **Leading Through Influence**: Can influence without authority, especially with research teams
- **High EQ**: Build strong rapport across functions (eng, research, design)
- **Decisiveness**: Make clear calls when team is stuck, even with incomplete information

**Anti-Pattern:** Avoid junior PMs who need structured onboarding and clear swim lanes - the environment is too ambiguous for this to work.

### Step 3: Structure Teams for Research-Product Integration
Break down silos between research and product teams.

**Old Model (Don't Do This):**
- Researchers build models → Hand off to product team → Product team ships
- Treats product team as "API consumers" of internal research
- Misses opportunities for iterative improvement

**New Model (Do This):**
- Every product team includes: PM + Engineers + Designers + Researchers
- Research and product collaborate from day one on:
  - Identifying problems to solve
  - Creating evals for those problems
  - Fine-tuning models using eval feedback
  - Iterating on product and model together

**Kevin's Insight:** "The best products are ENG, product, design, and research working together as a single team to build novel things."

### Step 4: Implement Lightweight, Adaptive Planning
Plan enough to align and identify dependencies, but expect to throw plans away.

**Planning Cadence:**
- Quarterly roadmapping meetings
- Year-long strategy documents (directional only)
- Weekly/daily tactical adjustments

**Planning Mindset:**
- Eisenhower principle: "Plans are useless. Planning is helpful."
- Use planning to:
  - Reflect on what worked/didn't work
  - Align on directional themes
  - Identify cross-team dependencies
  - Check resource availability
- Accept that 50%+ of the plan will change mid-quarter

**Critical Rule:** Never block shipping on waiting for a review - move forward if leadership is unavailable.

### Step 5: Empower Bottoms-Up Decision Making
Push decision-making to teams closest to the work.

**Operating Principles:**
- Set directional alignment at leadership level
- Let teams define specific solutions and execution
- Trust team members have strongest opinions and most context
- Encourage teams to ship without exec review for most features

**PM's Role in Decisiveness:**
- Don't make every decision (not "CEO of product")
- Don't make zero decisions (that's abdication)
- Make decisions when:
  - Team lacks confidence or empowerment
  - Decision has many disparate pros/cons across stakeholders
  - Ambiguity is blocking progress
  - No one else is stepping up

### Step 6: Optimize for Speed with Acceptable Error Rates
Create cultural permission to move fast and make mistakes.

**Cultural Norms:**
- Ship and iterate > perfect launch
- Fixing mistakes > avoiding all mistakes
- Learning velocity > planning perfection

**Examples of Acceptable Mistakes:**
- Naming conventions (OpenAI's model naming is "atrocious" - they know it and will fix later)
- Rolling back features that don't work
- Launching "research previews" that become major products (ChatGPT)

**Leadership's Role:**
- Explicitly reward speed (Kevin credits Sam Altman for pushing this)
- Normalize failures and rollbacks
- Deprioritize non-critical polish

### Step 7: Hire Product-Minded Engineers
Recruit engineers who think like product builders, not just implementers.

**Characteristics to Look For:**
- Strong opinions about user experience
- Proactive problem identification
- Comfortable making product tradeoffs
- Don't need detailed specs to move forward
- High execution speed

**Why This Matters with PM-Light Model:**
- Engineers must fill product thinking gaps
- Fewer PMs means engineers make more product calls
- Creates self-sufficient, fast-moving teams

### Step 8: Build Cross-Functional Researchers into Teams
Integrate ML/research talent into product teams (not just foundation model companies).

**Future Team Composition:**
- PM + Engineers + Designer + Researcher/ML Engineer
- Researcher responsibilities:
  - Fine-tuning models for use-case-specific performance
  - Creating and maintaining evals
  - Gathering training data from product usage
  - Optimizing model performance for cost/speed/accuracy

**Why This Will Become Universal:**
- Fine-tuned models outperform generic models for specific use cases
- AI will become like transistors - everywhere
- Every product team will customize models for their domain
- Research skills become core product development skills

**Kevin's Prediction:** "You're going to want quasi-researcher machine learning engineer types as part of pretty much every team because fine-tuning a model is just going to be part of the core workflow for building most products."

## Expected Outcomes
- Higher execution velocity despite smaller PM team
- More empowered, autonomous product teams
- Better research-product collaboration and iteration
- Faster adaptation to technology changes
- Products that improve as models improve
- Reduced coordination overhead and "deck culture"

## Common Pitfalls

### Pitfall 1: Applying This Model Too Early
**Problem:** Trying PM-light model without product-minded engineers or high-agency culture.
**Solution:** Build culture and hire for these traits before reducing PM ratios. This is an advanced organizational pattern.

### Pitfall 2: Confusing PM-Light with No Product Thinking
**Problem:** Too few PMs without product-minded engineers leads to engineering-first products.
**Solution:** PM-light requires product-minded engineers. If you don't have them, hire them first.

### Pitfall 3: Keeping Research and Product Siloed
**Problem:** Researchers hand off models; product teams can't influence model development.
**Solution:** Embed researchers in product teams from day one. They're teammates, not vendors.

### Pitfall 4: Blocking Shipping on Executive Review
**Problem:** Teams wait days/weeks for leadership review before launching.
**Solution:** Reserve exec reviews for highest-priority launches only. Ship most things without review.

### Pitfall 5: Hiring PMs Who Need Structure
**Problem:** Junior PMs or those who need clear swim lanes struggle in high-ambiguity environment.
**Solution:** Hire senior, high-agency PMs for ambiguous environments. Create structure elsewhere for developing PMs.

### Pitfall 6: Treating Plans as Commitments
**Problem:** Holding teams to quarterly roadmaps despite technology changes.
**Solution:** Use plans for alignment and dependencies, not commitments. Expect 50%+ to change.

## AI Integration Notes

### Context Signals for This SOP
- User is scaling product teams at AI/ML companies
- User mentions coordination overhead or slow shipping
- User asks about PM-to-engineer ratios
- User discusses research-product collaboration challenges
- User operates in rapidly evolving technology environment

### Adaptation Guidance

**For Early-Stage Startups (Pre-Series A):**
- Focus on Steps 2, 5, 6 (hiring, empowerment, speed)
- May not need formal planning processes yet
- Can operate with 1-2 PMs total

**For Growth-Stage Companies (Series B-D):**
- Implement all steps systematically
- Pay special attention to Steps 3-4 (research integration, lightweight planning)
- Scale PM team slowly; add engineers faster

**For Large Companies Adopting AI:**
- Start with Step 3 (research-product integration) as pilot
- May need to maintain higher PM ratios initially
- Focus on Step 8 (embedding researchers) as new muscle

**For Non-AI Companies:**
- Step 8 becomes increasingly relevant as AI adoption grows
- Start building research/ML capability on critical product teams
- Principles of high agency and speed still apply

### Key Principles to Emphasize
1. **PM-light requires high-quality PMs and product-minded engineers** - Not just about reducing headcount
2. **Speed beats perfection in fast-evolving tech** - You'll iterate anyway; ship faster
3. **Research and product must be integrated, not sequential** - Best products come from tight collaboration
4. **Plans provide alignment, not prophecy** - Planning is thinking exercise, not commitment
5. **High agency is non-negotiable** - In ambiguous environments, waiting for permission kills momentum

### Limitations and Edge Cases
- This model works best in fast-evolving technology environments (AI, emerging platforms)
- May not be optimal for highly regulated industries requiring extensive documentation
- Requires strong engineering talent market access
- Cultural fit is critical - won't work in risk-averse organizations
- Works better for B2B/developer tools than highly-polished consumer products initially
- May need modification for hardware products with longer iteration cycles
