## Overview
A meta-framework for recognizing and managing the tendency to over-correct when fixing organizational or strategic problems. The "pendulum swing" pattern occurs when teams identify an undesirable state, fix it aggressively, but swing too far in the opposite direction, creating a new problem. This framework helps leaders find the middle ground and avoid costly oscillations.

## When to Use
- When planning major strategic shifts or pivots
- After identifying significant organizational problems
- When considering dramatic changes to team structure or processes
- During retrospectives on past strategic decisions
- When noticing repeated patterns of swinging between extremes
- Before making bold hiring or organizational changes
- When debating how aggressively to pursue a new direction

## Prerequisites
- Honest assessment of current state
- Willingness to acknowledge past over-corrections
- Executive team alignment on the pattern
- Historical context of previous strategic shifts
- Ability to measure and monitor the change

## Procedure

### Step 1: Recognize the Pattern
Understand the common pendulum swing cycle and identify if you're in it.

**The Standard Pendulum Cycle**:
1. **Current state seems undesirable** - Something is clearly wrong
2. **Strong reaction to fix it** - "We need to change this!"
3. **Over-correction in opposite direction** - Going too far
4. **New undesirable state emerges** - Different but still problematic
5. **Recognition and rebalancing** - "Wait, we overcorrected"
6. **Find equilibrium** - Settle somewhere in the middle

**Key Insight from Paul Adams**:
> "The temptation is that you over-correct. And we've done this so many times in so many domains."

**Why This Happens**:
- Urgency to fix the problem drives aggressive action
- Pendulum momentum is hard to stop mid-swing
- New state seems better initially, masking problems
- Different people see problems at different times
- Takes time for negative consequences to become visible

### Step 2: Audit Your History for Pendulum Swings
Look back at major strategic changes to identify the pattern.

**Common Domains Where Pendulums Swing**:

**Product Strategy**:
- Differentiation vs. Table Stakes (see related SOP)
- Innovation vs. Stability
- Speed vs. Quality
- Customer-driven vs. Vision-driven
- Platform vs. Point Solution

**Hiring & Team Building**:
- Generalists vs. Specialists
- "People who've done it before" vs. "People who can figure it out"
- Culture fit vs. Diverse perspectives
- Internal promotion vs. External hiring
- Centralized vs. Decentralized teams

**Process & Culture**:
- Structured vs. Flexible
- Data-driven vs. Intuition-driven
- Fast decisions vs. Thorough analysis
- Individual autonomy vs. Team alignment

**Example from Intercom - Hiring Pendulum**:

**Initial State**: Team of generalists who haven't done this before
- **Undesirable**: "None of us have done this before. I don't think that's good. Do we even know what we're doing?"

**Over-Correction**: Hired lots of specialists who had done it before
- **New Problem**: "Brought the culture and ways of working of their prior company to Intercom"
- **Result**: "Didn't work out in a lot of cases. In most cases, it didn't work out."
- **Why**: "We weren't trying to be a bigger company that already exists. We're trying to be us."

**Landing Point**: "Let's hire someone who has done a bit of it and have a bit of specialism, not much, but enough to try and figure it out."

### Step 3: Identify Current Undesirable States
Honestly assess what's not working right now.

**Assessment Questions**:
1. **What is clearly not working?**
   - Be specific about the problem
   - Quantify impact if possible
   - Gather diverse perspectives

2. **Why is this undesirable?**
   - What outcomes are we not achieving?
   - Who is this hurting (customers, team, business)?
   - Is this urgent or just uncomfortable?

3. **Have we swung to an extreme?**
   - Are we at 80/20 or 90/10 in some dimension?
   - Do we have none of something we might need some of?
   - Are we ignoring a whole category of work/approach?

**Example - Differentiation vs. Table Stakes**:
- **Undesirable state identified**: "We've all the differentiation in the world, but people can't adopt the product, because we've never built any of these table stakes."
- **Evidence**: "Everyone loved it and really wanted to buy, but they couldn't, because we didn't have the basic report that they needed."

### Step 4: Plan the Correction (Not Over-Correction)
When fixing identified problems, plan for the middle, not the opposite extreme.

**Before Taking Action, Ask**:

1. **What's the opposite extreme?**
   - If we fix this problem too aggressively, what goes wrong?
   - What new problems could we create?
   - Who has over-corrected this way before?

2. **Where's the middle ground?**
   - What does balanced look like?
   - Can we define the target state numerically?
   - What indicators will show we're getting close?

3. **How high should the pendulum swing?**
   - Do we need to swing it at all?
   - Can we make incremental changes instead?
   - Is there urgency that justifies a swing?

**Paul's Reflection**:
> "Maybe the question is really, how high does the pendulum go? You got to swing it, and then it's like, how far do you swing it?"

**Strategic Principle**: Sometimes you must swing the pendulum to find the boundaries
> "To know where the boundary is, you got to cross it. And crossing it is painful. But, if you don't cross it, you'll never know."

### Step 5: Set Boundaries and Monitoring
Define what "too far" looks like before you start.

**Establish Warning Signs**:
For each correction, define indicators that you've gone too far.

**Example - Hiring Specialists**:
- **Warning signs that we've over-corrected**:
  - New hires struggle with ambiguity
  - "That's not how we did it at BigCo" becomes common phrase
  - Culture feels foreign to existing team
  - Specialists can't adapt when priorities shift

**Example - Building Table Stakes**:
- **Warning signs that we've over-corrected**:
  - No one excited about roadmap
  - Competitors shipping innovative features we lack
  - Just matching competitors, not leading
  - Lost differentiation in market positioning

**Create Monitoring Dashboard**:
- Track the metric you're trying to change
- Set target range, not just target point
- Review monthly to catch over-corrections early
- Assign owner to watch for warning signs

### Step 6: Accept That You Must Cross the Boundary
Recognize that sometimes over-correcting is the only way to find the right balance.

**The Boundary Principle**:
> "There was an idea that to know where the boundary is, you got to cross it. And crossing it is painful. But, if you don't cross it, you'll never know."

**Why This Matters**:
- If you stop before the boundary, you never know where it actually is
- "You think you're going up to the boundary and you stop before it, turns out it's actually miles over there"
- The pain of crossing it teaches you where not to go next time

**When to Deliberately Cross the Boundary**:
- When you have limited data about the right balance
- When the current state is clearly broken
- When experimentation cost is acceptable
- When you can recover from over-correction

**How to Cross Boundaries Safely**:
- Move quickly so you learn fast
- Watch for warning signs continuously
- Be prepared to reverse course
- Communicate that you're experimenting with the boundary

**Example from Privacy at Facebook/Google**:
> "At Google, privacy was really top of mind, to the point that it would block decisions, block product progress... circular conversations, and nothing ever got built or shipped... So, when I went to Facebook, I realized they have a different approach to privacy... there was an idea that to know where the boundary is, you got to cross it."

### Step 7: Build Organizational Humility
Create culture that can acknowledge and fix over-corrections.

**Cultural Prerequisites**:
- **Psychological safety**: Teams can say "we overcorrected"
- **Learning orientation**: Mistakes are learning opportunities
- **Ego management**: Leaders admit when swings went too far
- **Rapid iteration**: Can reverse course without shame

**Leadership Behaviors That Help**:
- Openly discuss past over-corrections
- Celebrate teams that catch swings early
- Make "pendulum" part of shared vocabulary
- Model course corrections publicly

**Example from Paul**:
> "You have no choice. You got to cross the boundary, feel the pain, be humble enough to realize you didn't get it right, and go again or whatever the corrective course is."

### Step 8: Find and Maintain Equilibrium
Once you've crossed boundaries, settle into sustainable balance.

**Signs You've Found the Middle**:
- Metrics stabilize in healthy range
- Team debates reduce (consensus emerges)
- Both extremes are represented but balanced
- System feels sustainable, not strained
- You're not talking about this problem anymore

**Example Equilibrium States from Intercom**:
- **Differentiation vs. Table Stakes**: "50/50 probably in terms of resources, but it has swung 70/30 in both directions at times"
- **Generalists vs. Specialists**: "Hire someone who has done a bit of it and have a bit of specialism, not much, but enough"

**Maintaining Equilibrium**:
- Continue monitoring key metrics
- Expect minor oscillations (this is normal)
- Don't over-react to small movements
- Review balance during planning cycles
- Accept that perfect balance is impossible

**Long-term Perspective**:
> "Product building is one, people is another one... we really over-corrected to find out, 'Okay, it's a balance here.'"

## Expected Outcomes
- Fewer dramatic organizational swings
- Faster recognition when over-corrections occur
- More sustainable middle-ground solutions
- Reduced organizational whiplash
- Better prediction of over-correction risks
- Smoother strategic changes
- Team trust that extremes will be recognized and corrected

## Common Pitfalls

**Pitfall 1: Refusing to Swing at All**
- **Problem**: Fear of over-correction prevents necessary change
- **How to Avoid**: Accept that sometimes you must cross the boundary to find it. The alternative is staying stuck in the current bad state.

**Pitfall 2: Not Recognizing You're in a Pendulum Swing**
- **Problem**: Teams don't realize they're over-correcting until it's too late
- **How to Avoid**: Use historical pattern recognition. Ask "Have we swung from X to Y before?" Make pendulum swings visible.

**Pitfall 3: Swinging Back Too Quickly**
- **Problem**: Correcting the over-correction before learning from it
- **How to Avoid**: Stay in the new state long enough to understand it. Set a minimum time period before reassessing.

**Pitfall 4: Blaming People for the Swing**
- **Problem**: Scapegoating leaders who drove the change
- **How to Avoid**: Recognize this is a systemic pattern, not individual failure. Focus on learning, not blame.

**Pitfall 5: Ignoring Warning Signs**
- **Problem**: Data shows over-correction but momentum prevents change
- **How to Avoid**: Set up monitoring before the swing. Assign someone to watch for warning signs. Empower them to raise concerns.

**Pitfall 6: Confusing Activity with Progress**
- **Problem**: Constant swinging feels like action but doesn't improve outcomes
- **How to Avoid**: Measure outcomes, not just activity. Are results actually improving or just changing?

**Pitfall 7: Not Documenting the Learning**
- **Problem**: Repeat the same pendulum swings because you forgot the lessons
- **How to Avoid**: Document what you learned about boundaries. Create institutional memory. Reference past swings in future decisions.

## Real-World Examples

### Example 1: Differentiation vs. Table Stakes (Intercom)
**Swing 1 - Too Much Differentiation**:
- Built innovative conversational UI
- Everyone loved it, couldn't fully adopt
- Missing basic features (reports, permissions)

**Swing 2 - Too Much Table Stakes**:
- Invested heavily in basic features
- "Missing all the table stakes"
- Lost differentiation focus

**Equilibrium Found**:
- "50/50 probably in terms of resources"
- "It has swung 70/30 in both directions at times"
- Conscious balancing act

### Example 2: Generalist vs. Specialist Hiring (Intercom)
**Initial State**: All generalists, no one who'd done it before
- **Problem**: "Do we even know what we're doing?"

**Over-Correction**: Hired experienced specialists
- **New Problem**: "Brought the culture and ways of working of their prior company"
- **Result**: "Didn't work out in most cases"
- **Why**: Cultural mismatch, not adaptable enough

**Equilibrium Found**:
- Hire people with "a bit of specialism, not much"
- Some experience, still adaptable
- Can figure things out in new context

### Example 3: Privacy Boundaries (Google to Facebook)
**Google Approach**: Extremely cautious on privacy
- **Result**: "Circular conversations, nothing ever got built or shipped"
- **Over-correction from**: Previous privacy concerns

**Facebook Approach**: Test the boundaries
- **Philosophy**: "To know where the boundary is, you got to cross it"
- **Risk**: Damaged brand through privacy issues
- **Learning**: Found actual boundaries through experimentation

**Lesson**: Both extremes have costs; Google couldn't ship, Facebook damaged trust

### Example 4: AI Strategy (Current Intercom)
**Initial State**: Pre-ChatGPT approach to ML
- Lots of manual setup and orchestration

**Potential Over-Correction Risk**: Going 100% AI
- Paul's reflection: "Fergal... gave us a pitch about how maybe all of our roadmap with AI is wrong"
- Question: "If this path plays out, everything we're doing now is going to be irrelevant"

**Current Approach**: Measured swing
- "All in" on AI but still building table stakes
- 50/50 AI differentiation vs. table stakes
- Aware of Horizon risks but focused on Horizon 1

## AI Integration Notes

### For AI Models Using This SOP

**Context Signals That Should Trigger This SOP**:
- User describing major strategic shift or organizational change
- Patterns of going from one extreme to another
- User mentions past failed initiatives or approaches
- Discussion of "we tried X and it didn't work, now we're trying opposite of X"
- Debates about how aggressively to pursue new direction
- Retrospectives on why previous changes didn't work

**How to Adapt for Different Situations**:
- **Startups**: May need to swing pendulums more to find boundaries quickly
- **Enterprise**: Higher cost of swinging, should move more incrementally
- **Crisis situations**: May need faster swings but with clear monitoring
- **Mature products**: Should have learned from past swings, move carefully

**Key Principles to Emphasize**:
1. Pendulum swings are normal organizational behavior
2. Sometimes you must cross the boundary to know where it is
3. The goal is not to avoid swinging but to recognize and rebalance
4. Over-correction creates new problems, not solutions
5. Humility to admit over-corrections is essential

**Questions to Help Users Apply This**:
- Have you made similar changes in the past? What happened?
- What would "too far" look like in this direction?
- What new problems might this correction create?
- How will you know if you've over-corrected?
- Where's the middle ground between current state and opposite extreme?
- What can you learn from others who've swung this pendulum?

**Warning Signals for AI to Flag**:
- User proposing 180-degree reversal of recent decision
- Extreme language like "all," "none," "always," "never"
- Plans that eliminate something entirely vs. rebalancing
- No discussion of risks or downsides of the change
- No plan for monitoring whether change is working
