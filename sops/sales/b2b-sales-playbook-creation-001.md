- **Difficulty**: Intermediate

## Overview
A B2B sales playbook is the codified, documented sales motion that enables you to scale from founder-led sales to a sales team. It's the "source code" of your sales process - the collection of slides, scripts, discovery questions, email templates, and demo flows that allow you to transfer your sales knowledge from your brain into other people's brains.

## When to Use
- You've achieved a 15-25% win rate across 50-100 arm's-length prospects
- You're preparing to hire your first 2-3 salespeople
- You need to standardize your sales approach for consistency
- You're ready to move from "it works on my local" to "deploying to the cloud" (scaling)
- You've identified repeatable patterns in how deals close

## Prerequisites
- Completed 20-30+ sales yourself as founder
- Documented your ICP (Ideal Customer Profile) and personas
- Established baseline conversion rates at each stage
- Have a CRM with historical data from your sales
- Minimum of 50 sales conversations completed

## Procedure

### Step 1: Extract Your Sales Motion Stages
- Map out every stage a prospect goes through from first contact to close
- Define what qualifies a prospect to move from one stage to the next
- Document typical timeframes between stages

**Example stages** (adapt to your motion):
1. First meeting/Discovery
2. Second meeting/Deep dive
3. Technical validation (e.g., "data light" for SaaS products)
4. Preview with stakeholders
5. Commercial discussion
6. Proposal
7. Closed-won

- Track stage conversion rates: What percentage move from Stage 1 → Stage 2, etc.
- Identify your target conversion rates at each stage

### Step 2: Document Discovery Questions
- List every question that reveals customer pain points
- Organize questions by topic/area
- Include follow-up questions that dig deeper
- Note which questions consistently lead to second meetings
- Document questions that make prospects think differently about their problem

**Key discovery areas to cover**:
- Current state: "How are you solving this problem today?"
- Pain magnitude: "What does this problem cost you?"
- Decision process: "Who else needs to be involved in this decision?"
- Timeline: "What would cause you to prioritize solving this?"
- Budget: "What budget do you have allocated for this type of solution?"

### Step 3: Create Your Pitch Deck
- Build a slide deck that can be used by any rep, not just you
- Create slides that handle common objections visually
- Ensure each slide has a clear talk track

**Essential slides**:
- Problem statement (that resonates with your ICP)
- How customers solve it today (and why that's inadequate)
- Your solution approach
- Demo or product overview
- Social proof / customer examples (for your ICP)
- Objection handlers (create slides as objections emerge)
- Pricing / packaging overview
- Next steps

**Updating process**:
- When a prospect asks a question you can't answer well, create a slide for it
- Update your deck after every 5-10 conversations
- Version control your deck so you can track what works

### Step 4: Build Demo Script
- Write out your complete demo flow
- Document the narrative arc of your demo
- Note where to pause for questions
- Include personalization points based on discovery
- Script transitions between sections

**Demo best practices**:
- Start with the end-user pain point
- Show the "after" state first, then explain how to get there
- Tie every feature to a pain point uncovered in discovery
- Keep demos under 30 minutes when possible
- Build in interaction points

### Step 5: Create Email Templates
- Draft templates for every stage of the sales process
- Include subject lines that get opens
- Create follow-up email sequences

**Key email templates needed**:
- Cold outreach (if doing outbound)
- Meeting confirmation
- Post-first meeting follow-up
- "Advancing the deal" emails
- Proposal delivery
- Dealing with stalls
- Closing emails

**Template guidelines**:
- Keep emails under 5 sentences when possible
- Always include a clear next step/call-to-action
- Personalize based on discovery
- Reference specific pain points discussed

### Step 6: Document Your ICP and Personas
- Define characteristics of accounts that have high win rates
- Identify firmographic attributes (company size, industry, tech stack)
- Document the personas involved in the buying process
- Map out which persona to start with and who needs to be involved eventually

**ICP elements**:
- Company size (employees)
- Revenue range
- Industry/vertical
- Tech stack or tools they use
- Team structure
- Specific characteristics that indicate fit

**Persona mapping**:
- End user (who feels the pain)
- Manager (who may own the budget)
- Executive (who approves larger purchases)
- Technical buyer (who evaluates integration/security)

### Step 7: Define Success Metrics
- Document your conversion rates at each stage
- Set activity benchmarks (meetings per week, emails sent, etc.)
- Establish win rate targets
- Define average deal size and sales cycle length

**Key metrics to track**:
- Opportunities created per week
- Stage conversion rates
- Win rate (opportunities → closed-won)
- Average selling price (ASP)
- Sales cycle length (first meeting → close)
- Second meeting rate
- Proposal → close rate

### Step 8: Create Onboarding Materials
- Build a training document that walks through the entire sales motion
- Include mock discovery conversation examples
- Record yourself doing a demo (or multiple demos)
- Create a "first week" checklist for new reps

**Onboarding components**:
- Product knowledge training materials
- ICP and persona documentation
- Discovery question library
- Demo recording(s)
- Email templates
- Pitch deck with notes
- CRM stage definitions and process
- Mock sales call exercises

### Step 9: Document Common Objections and Responses
- List every objection you've heard
- Write out your best response to each
- Include slides that address objections visually when possible

**Common objection categories**:
- Price ("Too expensive")
- Timing ("Not a priority right now")
- Competitive ("We use [competitor]")
- Build vs. buy ("We could build this ourselves")
- Risk ("You're too early stage")

### Step 10: Package Everything into a Single Resource
- Organize all materials into a shared folder or workspace
- Create a "Sales Playbook" master document that references everything
- Make it easy for new reps to find what they need
- Version control the playbook and update regularly

## Expected Outcomes
- Complete sales playbook that can be handed to new sales hires
- Documented sales process with clear stages and conversion targets
- Repeatable messaging that works across multiple sellers
- Reduced ramp time for new sales hires
- Consistent customer experience regardless of which rep they talk to
- Foundation for scaling from 2 reps to 4 to 8 to 16

## Common Pitfalls
- **Perfectionism**: Waiting until the playbook is "perfect" before hiring. The playbook will never be perfect - start with "good enough" and iterate.
- **Over-documentation**: Creating a 100-page document no one will read. Keep it practical and actionable.
- **Static playbook**: Creating it once and never updating. The playbook should be living documentation that evolves.
- **No examples**: Providing frameworks without concrete examples. Include real customer stories and conversations.
- **Skipping this step**: Hiring salespeople without a playbook and expecting them to figure it out. This leads to inconsistent results and high failure rates.
- **Only documenting what**: Documenting what to say but not why. Help reps understand the reasoning behind each approach.

## AI Integration Notes
Context signals that should trigger this SOP:
- User mentions they've closed 20+ customers themselves
- User is preparing to hire first salespeople
- User asks how to scale sales beyond themselves
- User struggles with inconsistent sales results
- User mentions reps can't replicate founder's success

How to adapt for different situations:
- For highly technical products: Emphasize demo script and technical objection handling
- For short sales cycles: Focus more on email templates and first meeting conversion
- For long sales cycles: Detail multi-threading strategies and stakeholder mapping
- For PLG products: Include product-led sales motion and expansion playbook

Limitations and edge cases:
- Very early stage (< 10 customers): Too early for a full playbook - focus on founder-led sales first
- Highly customized sales: Harder to standardize, focus on discovery framework
- Multiple ICPs: May need separate mini-playbooks for each segment
