- **Applicable To**: Founders, sales leaders selling to enterprise ($1M-10M ARR)
- **Difficulty**: Advanced

## Overview
A comprehensive framework for selling to large enterprise customers (Fortune 1000, 500+ employees) as an early-stage startup. This SOP covers why to target tier-one logos, how to price enterprise deals, navigating procurement, and leveraging creative deal structuring to win despite being small and unproven.

## When to Use
- You're selling B2B software to companies with 500+ employees
- You want to target Fortune 500/1000 companies
- Your product can deliver $75K-150K+ in annual value
- You're willing to run a consultative, relationship-driven sales process
- You have 6-12 month sales cycles and need to navigate procurement
- You're at $1M+ ARR and ready to go upmarket

## Prerequisites
- Product-market fit validated with 7-10+ customers
- Ability to articulate clear business value (not just features)
- Founder or senior exec available to engage in sales process
- Runway to support 6-12 month sales cycles
- Willingness to customize and co-create with customers
- Understanding of your differentiation (not just "better than X")

## Procedure

### Step 1: Target Tier-One Logos (Counterintuitive Strategy)

**Goal**: Prioritize the biggest, most prestigious companies in your target market - NOT the smaller, "easier" companies.

#### Why Target Tier-One Companies

**Conventional Wisdom (WRONG)**:
- "Start with smaller companies to learn"
- "Big companies move too slow"
- "You'll screw up the relationship"
- "They won't take meetings with startups"

**Jen Abel's Contrarian View (RIGHT)**:

1. **Tier-one logos ARE the early adopters**:
   - Their job is to stay #1 in their industry
   - Staying #1 is harder than getting to #1
   - They need to take swings on new technology to maintain advantage
   - They're willing to experiment for even "slight alpha"

2. **Tier-one logos unlock all other logos**:
   - If you land Walmart, every retailer wants to know what Walmart is doing
   - "We're working with [Tier-1]" opens all doors
   - Referenceability is 10x more powerful

3. **Tier-one logos have the best talent**:
   - Most strategic thinkers work at top companies
   - They can pull you in the right direction
   - They understand what "good" looks like

4. **Investors and employees care**:
   - Tier-one logos excite investors (fundraising advantage)
   - Tier-one logos attract top talent (recruiting advantage)
   - Tier-one logos give you credibility

**What is a "Tier-One" Logo?**
- Fortune 1000 companies
- Industry leaders (#1 or #2 in their space)
- Examples: Walmart, McDonald's, NVIDIA, Tesla, Chevron, UnitedHealthcare
- NOT: Mid-market companies, regional players, or startups

#### How to Identify Your Tier-One Targets

**Step-by-Step**:

1. **List the top 10 companies in your target industry**:
   - Who is #1 in retail, healthcare, finance, manufacturing, etc.?
   - Who has the most to lose by being disrupted?
   - Who is most forward-thinking?

2. **Identify which ones are investing in innovation**:
   - Have they acquired startups recently?
   - Do they have innovation labs or venture arms?
   - Are they in the news for digital transformation?

3. **Find the specific person/team**:
   - Not "Walmart" but "Head of Supply Chain Operations at Walmart"
   - Not "Nike" but "VP of Digital Product at Nike"
   - LinkedIn is your friend here

4. **Prioritize by innovation appetite**:
   - Rank your tier-one targets by how likely they are to experiment
   - Technology companies are often easier first targets (they get it)
   - Traditional industries (retail, healthcare, finance) are harder but huge opportunity

**Pro Tip**: "Technology companies make great design partners because they're used to experimenting and giving feedback. They were once startups themselves."

### Step 2: Sell Vision, Not Problems (Vision Casting)

**Goal**: Position your product as an opportunity for alpha/advantage, not just a solution to a problem.

#### Problem Selling vs. Vision Casting

**Problem Selling** (What typical salespeople do):
```
"You have this problem → Here's our solution → Buy our product"
- Technical, feature-focused
- Transactional
- Feels like being sold to
```

**Vision Casting** (What founders do naturally):
```
"Here's where you are today → Here's the alpha you're missing →
Here's what you'll be able to do tomorrow that your competitors can't"
- Strategic, outcome-focused
- Transformational
- Feels like partnership and opportunity
```

#### How to Vision Cast

**Framework: Sell the "Mario on Blast" Not the "Mushroom"**

Reference to the famous image:
- Don't sell the mushroom (the tool/feature)
- Sell Mario transformed into Super Mario (the outcome/superpower)

**Examples**:

**Bad (Problem Selling)**:
- "Our AI tool automates data entry, saving you 10 hours/week"
- "We're better than Competitor X because we have feature Y"

**Good (Vision Casting)**:
- "You'll be able to hire the 10X engineers who won't even join companies without Cursor" (Cursor example)
- "You'll have access to information 1 second before everyone else, giving you trading alpha" (High-frequency trading example)
- "You'll be able to deliver custom experiences at scale that feel like 1:1 relationships"

**The Vision Casting Formula**:

1. **Current State**: Here's where you are today
2. **Gap/Opportunity**: Here's the alpha you're missing (not the problem you have)
3. **Future State**: Here's what you'll be able to do that no one else can
4. **Urgency**: Here's why now matters (competitive pressure, market shift, etc.)

**Key Distinction**:
- Alpha = Competitive advantage, information advantage, talent advantage, speed advantage
- Problem = "Our reporting is slow" or "Our tool is clunky"

**When selling to executives**: They care about alpha, not problems. Problems are for middle management.

### Step 3: Price Boldly ($75K-150K+ ACV)

**Goal**: Set pricing that reflects enterprise value and trains the market to respect your product.

#### Why Pricing Matters for Enterprise

**The Danger of Pricing Too Low**:

1. **Anchoring Problem**:
   - If you sell to Walmart for $10K, you can't go to $100K later
   - Procurement will flag it: "You paid $10K last year, now they want $100K??"
   - You've permanently capped your expansion

2. **Executive Engagement Problem**:
   - $10K deals don't require executive approval
   - If exec isn't involved, they're not invested
   - Deal becomes "nice to have" not "must have"

3. **False Signal Problem**:
   - Low price might get you customers, but wrong customers
   - They're not willing to pay real value → they churn
   - You build for the wrong segment

4. **Expansion Economics Problem**:
   - Easier to go from $100K → $500K than $10K → $100K
   - 5x growth vs. 10x growth
   - The math breaks at small ACVs for venture-backed companies

**Typical Enterprise Pricing Bands**:

| Deal Size | Executive Level Required | Procurement Intensity | Typical Use Case |
|-----------|-------------------------|----------------------|-----------------|
| < $10K | Manager/Director | Low (may bypass) | Department tool |
| $10-50K | Director/Senior Director | Medium | Department-wide initiative |
| $50-100K | VP/SVP | High | Division-wide initiative |
| $100-250K | SVP/C-Suite | Very High | Company-wide initiative |
| $250K+ | C-Suite | Intense | Strategic partnership |

**Recommended Starting Point for Startups**: $75K-150K

**Why $75K-150K is the "Sweet Spot"**:
- Enterprises are "very used to" this range
- Requires executive involvement (they're bought in)
- Not so large that you need extensive proof (< $250K)
- Leaves room for expansion to $500K-1M
- Justifies the 6-12 month sales cycle

#### How to Defend High Pricing

**Common Objection**: "That's too expensive for an early-stage startup product"

**Response Framework**:

1. **Value-Based Justification**:
   "Let's break down the value. If this saves your team 20 hours/week across 50 people,
   that's 1,000 hours/week or 50,000 hours/year. At $100/hour loaded cost, that's $5M in value.
   We're asking for $150K, which is 3% of the value we're delivering."

2. **Opportunity Cost Framing**:
   "What's the cost of NOT solving this? If your competitor gets this alpha before you do,
   what does that mean for your market position?"

3. **Executive Time Value**:
   "Your exec team is spending 10 hours/month on this problem. That's worth $50K+ alone.
   We're asking for $100K to give them 120 hours back per year."

4. **Co-Creation Value**:
   "You're not just buying software. You're getting a partner who will build specifically
   for your use case, integrate with your systems, and ensure your success."

**When to Discount** (Use Sparingly):

✅ **Good Reasons to Discount**:
- They're a design partner (committing to feedback, early access, iteration)
- They'll be a reference customer (speaking at your conference, case study, etc.)
- They're giving you access to executive insights
- They're willing to do a 2-3 year commitment

❌ **Bad Reasons to Discount**:
- "To get the deal done" (negotiating with yourself)
- They're price-shopping you against competitors
- They're nickel-and-diming you (red flag - they're not bought in)

**Discount Framework** (If You Must):
```
Standard Price: $150K
Design Partner Discount: 30% ($105K)
But: You commit to:
  - Quarterly feedback sessions
  - Annual case study
  - Reference calls (3 per year)
  - 2-year contract minimum

And: You'll always have 30% concession in perpetuity as a thank you for being early.
We'll grow the price as we add value, but you'll always be 30% below list.
```

### Step 4: Leverage Services to Get in the Door

**Goal**: Use consulting/services to build trust, get paid while learning, and pave the way for technology adoption.

#### The Service-First Strategy (Counterintuitive)

**Common Founder Fear**: "My investors don't want services revenue"

**Reality**: 40-50% of B2B SaaS companies sell services before technology in enterprise.

**Why Services Work for Enterprise**:

1. **Enterprises know how to buy services**:
   - Largest budget line item
   - Fast procurement (no IT review for consulting)
   - Low perceived risk

2. **Enterprises may not be ready for your technology**:
   - No existing process/strategy for the problem
   - Don't know how to integrate/implement
   - Need education before adoption

3. **You get paid to educate**:
   - Build trust while learning their environment
   - Position yourself as the expert
   - Design the strategy they'll use your tech to execute

4. **You de-risk the tech sale**:
   - Foot in the door
   - Proven relationship
   - Easier to upsell to technology

#### Types of Services to Offer

**1. Strategy/Process Design** ($10-30K):
```
"You haven't defined a process for [problem] yet.
Let us come in for 90 days and help you design the process,
then we can discuss how our technology fits into it."
```

**Example**: AI startup helping company design their AI strategy before selling AI platform.

**2. Implementation/Integration** ($20-50K):
```
"Your existing tools don't talk to each other.
Let us map out the integration architecture and build the connectors,
then we can layer our technology on top."
```

**Example**: Data company helping client integrate existing data sources before selling data platform.

**3. Education/Enablement** ($10-20K):
```
"Your team isn't trained on [new methodology].
Let us run a 6-week enablement program to get them up to speed,
then introduce the technology."
```

**Example**: Product management tool teaching company modern product practices before selling the tool.

**4. Custom Pitch/Business Case** ($5-15K):
```
"You need to pitch this to your CEO/Board.
Let us help you build the business case and ROI model,
which will include our solution as part of the recommendation."
```

**Example**: Security startup building CISO's board presentation on cybersecurity strategy.

#### Service-to-Technology Transition

**90-Day Service Contracts** (Recommended):
```
Month 1-3: Service engagement ($30K)
  - Learn their environment
  - Build trust
  - Design process/strategy
  - Prove value

Month 4: Technology pilot ($10K/month for 3 months)
  - Introduce platform
  - Small team usage
  - Validate technical fit

Month 7+: Full technology contract ($100-150K/year)
  - Roll out to full organization
  - Ongoing service/support
  - Expansion potential
```

**Time-Boxing is Critical**:
- Always 90-day increments (don't lock yourself into yearlong service contracts)
- Have clear exit to technology sale
- Services should be margin-positive but not your business model

**Famous Examples**:
- **Palantir**: Forward Deployed Engineers (essentially consulting to sell platform)
- **OpenAI**: Worked with CTOs before ChatGPT launch to educate on AI strategy
- **Many AI startups**: Sold "AI strategy consulting" before selling AI platforms

### Step 5: Navigate Procurement Strategically

**Goal**: Turn the procurement process from a deal-killer into a competitive moat.

#### Understanding Enterprise Procurement

**The Procurement Mindset**:
> "Buying is just as hard as selling right now. Enterprises are designed to make it hard to buy
> because they want to get rid of mediocre 'this might be good' and only get 'this will change
> how we work.'" - Jen Abel

**Procurement Stakeholders**:

1. **Business Buyer** (Your Champion):
   - The person who wants your product
   - Usually Director/VP level
   - Needs to justify the purchase internally

2. **Economic Buyer** (Budget Owner):
   - Usually SVP or C-Suite
   - Controls the budget
   - Needs executive-level value proposition

3. **Procurement** (Professional Buyers):
   - Their job is to negotiate and de-risk
   - Very smart, do this for a living
   - Can kill deals by suggesting alternative vendors

4. **Legal** (Contract Review):
   - Reviews terms, liability, IP
   - Can add months to the process
   - Looks for red flags in language

5. **IT/Security** (Technical Validation):
   - Security review, architecture review
   - SOC 2, penetration testing, compliance checks
   - Can add 30-90 days to the process

6. **Signatory** (Final Approval):
   - Could be CFO, CLO, Business Unit Head, or Procurement Head
   - Different companies have different policies
   - **CRITICAL**: Know who this is BEFORE entering procurement

#### Procurement Success Tactics

**Tactic 1: Make Their Job Easy**
```
"I want to make this as easy as possible for you.
Give me all the forms you need filled out, and I'll complete them for you.
You can review and edit as needed."
```

**Why This Works**:
- You're a small deal in their world
- Easy for you to get sidelined
- Doing their work moves you up the priority queue

**Tactic 2: Simplify Your Positioning**
```
"Here's exactly what we do: [1 sentence]
Here's exactly what we DON'T do: [2-3 sentences]"
```

**Why This Works**:
- If they can't classify you, they send you to "kitchen sink" contracting
- Kitchen sink = $5M insurance policy, unlimited audit rights, etc.
- Clear positioning = appropriate risk classification = faster approval

**Tactic 3: Know the Signatory Early**

Ask your business buyer:
```
"Before we enter procurement, who will ultimately sign this contract?
I want to make sure they have everything they need to understand what they're approving."
```

**Then prepare a 1-page summary for the signatory**:
- What is this product?
- Why are we buying it?
- What problem does it solve?
- What's the ROI?
- Why this vendor?
- What are the risks?

**Why This Works**:
- Signatories often have no context
- If confused, they kick it back → you lose queue position
- Proactive summary prevents this

**Tactic 4: Split Service and Technology Contracts**

If you're selling both:
```
Contract A: Services ($30K, 90 days)
  - Fast approval (services are easy to buy)
  - Gets you in the door
  - Builds relationship

Contract B: Technology ($120K, annual)
  - Slower approval (IT review required)
  - But you're already onboarding (pressure to complete)
  - Service contract creates urgency
```

**Why This Works**:
- Service contracts can start while tech is in procurement
- Creates momentum and urgency ("We're already working with them")
- Gives you revenue during long procurement cycles

**Tactic 5: Differentiate Clearly**

**Procurement will suggest alternatives**:
> "We have 17 other preferred vendors that do similar work. Why don't you just use one of them?"

**Your defense must be**:
- Not "we're better" (subjective, unwinnable argument)
- But "we're different" (objective, creates new category)

**Example**:
```
❌ "We're better than Salesforce because we have feature X"
   → Procurement: "Salesforce can probably build that. Use Salesforce."

✅ "We're fundamentally different from Salesforce. They're for sales CRM,
    we're for [new category]. Here's what we enable that no CRM can: [unique alpha]."
   → Procurement: "OK, this is a new category. Approved."
```

#### Procurement Timelines to Expect

**Typical Enterprise Procurement Timeline**:
```
IT Security Review: 30-60 days
Legal Review: 30-45 days
Procurement Negotiation: 30-60 days
Signature Queue: 15-30 days
---
Total: 105-195 days (3.5-6.5 months)
```

**Factors That Extend Timeline**:
- First-time vendor (no existing relationship)
- New category (hard to classify)
- High perceived risk (handles sensitive data)
- Budget not pre-allocated (need to create budget)
- Missing executive sponsorship (low priority)

**How to Shorten Timeline**:
- Executive sponsor pushing internally
- Budget already allocated
- Existing vendor relationship (even for different product)
- Simple, clear positioning
- Proactive form completion
- Service contract creating urgency

### Step 6: Co-Author Deals (Creative Deal Structuring)

**Goal**: Make every deal feel custom-crafted for the customer while maintaining your core offering.

#### The Art of Deal Crafting

> "Every enterprise deal looks different, and that's okay. It's all about deal crafting.
> It's the art of sales." - Jen Abel

**Why Co-Authoring Works**:

1. **Customer feels like it's built for them**:
   - "The power of specificity"
   - They're more invested if they helped design it
   - Reduces churn risk

2. **You learn about their buying maturity**:
   - Do they have existing process/strategy?
   - Do they know how to buy this type of product?
   - What's their implementation readiness?

3. **You can diagnose readiness**:
   - If they can't articulate scope → Not ready to buy tech yet (sell service first)
   - If they have clear scope → Ready for tech
   - If they have implementation team → Can move fast

#### The Co-Authoring Process

**Step 1: Initial Scope Discussion** (Call 3-4 in the sales process)
```
"Based on our conversations, here's what I think we should focus on:
  - [Component 1]: [Value/Outcome]
  - [Component 2]: [Value/Outcome]
  - [Component 3]: [Value/Outcome]

Does this resonate? What am I missing? What's less important?"
```

**Step 2: Collaborative Refinement**
```
"Let's co-author this together. Here's what I'd love your input on:
  - Are these the right priorities?
  - What would make this a home run for you?
  - What would make this easier to get approved internally?
  - Are there any constraints I should know about?"
```

**Step 3: Flexible Pricing Structure**

**Example Co-Authored Deal**:
```
Standard Offering: $150K/year
  - Platform access for 50 users
  - Standard integrations
  - Email support

Customer Needs:
  - Want 100 users
  - Need custom integration with legacy system
  - Want white-glove support for first 6 months

Co-Authored Deal: $185K/year
  - Platform access for 100 users (+$20K)
  - Custom integration included (+$15K value, no charge - builds relationship)
  - Dedicated CSM for first 6 months (included - strategic investment)
  - 2-year commitment required (lock-in justifies concessions)
  - Year 2 price: $220K (expansion built in)
```

**Step 4: Framing the Co-Authored Deal**
```
"Here's what we've crafted together. This is customized for your needs:
  - [Custom element 1]: This ensures [their outcome]
  - [Custom element 2]: This addresses [their constraint]
  - [Concession you made]: We're including this because [strategic reason]
  - [Ask you're making]: To make this work, we need [commitment/referral/etc.]

Does this feel like a win for you? What would make it a no-brainer?"
```

#### Negotiation Tactics

**Ask for Co-Authoring on Price**:
```
"This is a $150K engagement. I'm open to co-authoring it with you.
We can make it bigger if you need more scope in year one.
We can make it a bit smaller in year one if we step it up in year two.
How do we structure this so when you go to bat internally, it's a clear win?"
```

**Why This Works**:
- Puts customer in control
- They're negotiating with themselves (not you)
- Builds trust (you're transparent and flexible)
- They're more likely to defend it internally

**Concession Framework**:

**What to Give Away** (Low cost to you, high value to them):
- Custom onboarding/training
- Executive access (quarterly business reviews)
- Early access to new features
- Custom integrations (that you'll reuse)
- Speaking opportunity at your conference
- Extended trial period for additional teams

**What to Get in Return**:
- Longer contract term (2-3 years)
- Reference customer status
- Case study rights
- Higher total contract value (even if year 1 is lower)
- Referrals to other divisions/companies
- Product feedback and testing

**What NOT to Give Away** (Without getting something back):
- Steep discounts (> 30%) without design partner commitment
- Unlimited scope creep
- IP rights or data ownership
- Exclusivity agreements
- Most favored nation clauses

### Step 7: Build Relationships, Not Transactions

**Goal**: Create deep relationships with enterprise buyers that transcend individual deals.

#### The Relationship Advantage

> "Every single enterprise deal I have done, the deal is done, the deal is closed and
> pretty much done through text. It is a relationship you're building with someone." - Jen Abel

**Why Relationships Matter**:

1. **Speed**: When your champion can text you, things move 10x faster
2. **Trust**: They go to bat for you internally
3. **Expansion**: Easy to upsell when relationship is strong
4. **Retention**: Strong relationships prevent churn
5. **Referrals**: They introduce you to peers and other divisions

#### How to Build Enterprise Relationships

**Tactic 1: Be Immediately Responsive**
```
If your enterprise client calls or texts, answer immediately.
If they email, respond within an hour (even if just "I'm on it, will have an answer by EOD").
```

**Why**: They're used to vendors being slow. Your speed is a competitive advantage.

**Tactic 2: Turn Over Rocks for Them**
```
"I know it's important we get this done this year. I'll do everything humanly possible
to make it happen. What do you need from me?"
```

**Example**: Jen's client at Fortune 10 company moved a deal forward because of the relationship:
> "She said 'It's a tall order, but if it's going to help you, let's do it.'
> These are how enterprise deals get done. It's relationships."

**Tactic 3: Ask the Hard Questions**
```
"Honestly, do we think we're going to get this deal done this year? Is it possible?"
"What's your real concern here? I want to make sure we're addressing the right thing."
"If you were me, what would you be worried about with this deal?"
```

**Why**: You can only ask these once you have a relationship. They give you the real answer.

**Tactic 4: Invest in Their Success**
```
Send them relevant articles (not about your product)
Introduce them to useful contacts in your network
Offer to help with their other projects (even if not using your product)
Attend their events/initiatives
```

**Why**: You're a partner, not a vendor. Partners help unconditionally.

**Tactic 5: Quarterly Business Reviews (QBRs)**

**Even Before They're a Customer**:
```
"I'd love to do a quarterly check-in, even if we're not working together yet.
I can share what we're learning from the market, and you can tell me how your
priorities are evolving. No sales agenda."
```

**After They're a Customer**:
```
Quarterly agenda:
  - How are you using the product?
  - What's working / not working?
  - What are your evolving priorities?
  - How can we help you win internally?
  - What should we build next?
```

**Why**: Regular touchpoints build relationship equity and surface opportunities early.

## Expected Outcomes

After mastering enterprise sales:

- **Tier-one logo wins** (Fortune 1000 companies as customers)
- **$100K+ ACV deals** consistently closed
- **Strong reference customers** who open doors to others
- **Predictable 6-12 month sales cycles** with clear stages
- **High win rates** (20-40%) because you're qualification is excellent
- **Expansion revenue** from existing accounts (2-5x growth year over year)
- **Competitive moat** from being first into enterprise accounts
- **Deep market insights** from working with sophisticated buyers
- **Pricing power** (not competing on price, competing on value)

**Timeline Expectations**:
- First enterprise deal: 6-12 months from first contact
- Second deal: 4-8 months (learning curve helps)
- Steady state: 3-6 months for similar profiles

## Common Pitfalls

### Pitfall 1: Starting with Small Companies to "Learn"
**Problem**: Targeting mid-market companies because they seem "easier."

**Why It Fails**:
- You're learning the wrong lessons (different buying behavior)
- You're not building tier-one references
- You're leaving the best opportunities on the table

**Solution**: Go straight to tier-one. You'll learn faster and build better references.

### Pitfall 2: Pricing Too Low
**Problem**: Charging $10-20K for enterprise deals because you're "early stage."

**Why It Fails**:
- Can't expand (anchoring problem)
- Executives not involved (no executive value)
- Math breaks (can't build $100M business on $10K ACVs)

**Solution**: Price at $75-150K minimum. Enterprises expect this.

### Pitfall 3: Avoiding Services
**Problem**: "My investors don't want services revenue."

**Why It Fails**:
- You miss the fastest path into the account
- Competitor sells services and gets the tech sale later
- You wait 18 months for them to be "ready" for tech

**Solution**: 40-50% of B2B companies sell services first. Do it strategically with 90-day increments.

### Pitfall 4: Entering Procurement Without Executive Sponsorship
**Problem**: Sending deal to procurement when only a Director is sponsoring.

**Why It Fails**:
- Low priority in procurement queue
- Easy to get killed by "use existing vendor" recommendation
- No one fighting for you internally

**Solution**: Don't go to procurement until SVP/C-Suite is sponsoring. If needed, run a pilot/service to build exec relationship first.

### Pitfall 5: Not Knowing the Signatory
**Problem**: Getting to final signature and CFO/CLO has no idea what they're signing.

**Why It Fails**:
- They kick it back with questions
- You lose queue position
- Adds 30-60 days to deal

**Solution**: Know signatory before entering procurement. Prep them with 1-page summary.

### Pitfall 6: Competing on "Better Than X"
**Problem**: Positioning as "better than [incumbent]."

**Why It Fails**:
- Procurement says "Let's give incumbent a chance to improve"
- You're in a comparison → You're not differentiated
- Better is subjective and hard to defend

**Solution**: Position as DIFFERENT (new category, new alpha, new opportunity).

### Pitfall 7: Treating Every Deal the Same
**Problem**: Using standardized contracts and pricing for all enterprise deals.

**Why It Fails**:
- Enterprise buyers expect customization
- You miss creative deal structures
- Deals die from inflexibility

**Solution**: Co-author every deal. Make them feel custom while protecting your core business.

## AI Integration Notes

**Context Signals for AI Models**:
- User mentions "selling to Fortune 500" or "enterprise sales"
- User asks about "procurement" or "navigating legal"
- User mentions deal sizes of $50K+ or sales cycles of 6+ months
- User expresses concern about being "too small" to sell to big companies
- User asks about "tier-one logos" or "reference customers"
