- **Difficulty**: Intermediate

## Overview
Hiring your first salespeople is a critical inflection point for B2B startups. This SOP outlines when to hire, who to hire (and who NOT to hire), and how to set them up for success. The key insight is to hire 2-3 early-stage sellers first, not a VP of Sales, and to prove the model works before scaling.

## When to Use
- You've achieved 15-25% win rate across 50-100 arm's-length prospects
- You've closed 20-30+ customers yourself as founder
- Your sales motion is documented and repeatable
- You're hitting capacity constraints (can't do more meetings yourself)
- You have a clear ICP and personas defined
- You have budget for 2-3 sales hires (not just one)

## Prerequisites
- Documented sales playbook with slides, scripts, templates
- CRM with historical data showing your conversion rates
- Clear ICP (Ideal Customer Profile)
- Proven win rate of 15-25% or better
- Budget for at least 2 sellers (preferably 2-3)
- Founder/CEO committed to being sales manager initially

## Procedure

### Step 1: Determine Readiness - Validate You Should Hire
- Confirm you can reliably close 1.5-2.5 customers per 10 first meetings
- Verify this pattern across at least 50-100 total opportunities
- Ensure your win rate is statistically significant, not lucky
- Check that you have documented your sales motion (playbook complete)

**Red flags you're not ready**:
- Win rate below 15% or very inconsistent
- Haven't done 50+ sales conversations yourself
- Sales playbook doesn't exist or is incomplete
- Trying to hire because you "don't like sales" rather than hitting capacity limits

### Step 2: Decide NOT to Hire a VP of Sales First
- Resist the urge to hire a "VP of Sales who's been there before"
- Recognize that experienced VPs haven't been selling recently
- Understand that VPs need proof that product-market fit exists
- Acknowledge that your sales motion is still in your brain, not fully documented

**Why VPs fail at this stage**:
- They haven't sold in years (managed sellers instead)
- They expect polished sales infrastructure you don't have yet
- They're expensive and may not be willing to roll up sleeves
- As Jason Lemkin tweeted: "Why does someone who scaled Datadog want to come to your crappy little startup?"

### Step 3: Define Your Ideal First Seller Profile
Look for "early-stage pioneer sellers" with these characteristics:
- **Experience level**: 2-5 years of selling experience (not brand new, not too senior)
- **Stage experience**: Previously at early-stage companies (pre-Series B)
- **Similar motion**: Sold to similar personas at similar price points
- **Scrappy attitude**: Comfortable with incomplete materials and ambiguity
- **Recent selling**: Currently selling or was selling within last year

**Example profile**:
- AE who was one of the first 5-10 sellers at a successful company
- Sold to your ICP (e.g., if you sell to recruiters, they sold recruiting software)
- Average deal size within 2x of yours
- Similar sales cycle length
- Deputy or individual contributor, not management

**Companies to target** (examples):
- Early sellers from Greenhouse, Lever (if selling to recruiters)
- Early Figma sellers (if selling design tools)
- Early Dropbox sellers (if selling to knowledge workers)
- Look for companies 2-3 years ahead of you that sold to similar buyers

### Step 4: Plan to Hire 2-3 Sellers, Not Just One
- Budget for 2-3 reps, not a single hire
- Recognize that hiring one gives you no comparison data
- Understand you need to see if the pattern replicates across multiple people
- Plan to onboard them together or in quick succession

**Why multiples matter**:
- If one fails, you don't know if it's the person or the playbook
- If two succeed, you've proven the model scales
- Creates internal competition and peer learning
- Faster path to learning what works

### Step 5: Create Written Screening Assessment
- Build a Google Doc with 10-12 biographical questions
- Share doc with edit access and ask candidates to complete it
- Use this as first filter before any calls

**Sample questions**:
- "Tell me about something you've built that you're proud of"
- "Describe a deal you lost and what you learned"
- "Walk me through your sales process at your current/last company"
- "What's your approach to discovery?"
- "Tell me about a time you had to sell without complete materials"

**What this screens for**:
- 57% of people won't complete it (filters low effort)
- Writing ability and communication skills
- Attention to detail (typos, skipped questions)
- Actual sales experience and thoughtfulness
- Cultural fit and motivation

### Step 6: Interview for Early-Stage Skills
During interviews, assess:
- **Grit and scrappiness**: Can they handle incomplete materials?
- **Learning agility**: How quickly do they adapt?
- **Activity orientation**: Are they high-energy and proactive?
- **Rapport building**: Do they make you feel comfortable?
- **Question asking**: Do they ask good discovery questions?

**Interview techniques**:
- Mock discovery call: Have them discover your "problems" as if you're a prospect
- Pitch exercise: Give them your deck, 30 minutes to prepare, have them pitch back
- Objection handling: Throw common objections and see how they respond
- Reference checks: Talk to people they've sold with (not just managers)

### Step 7: Set Clear Expectations and Metrics
- Define leading and lagging indicators they'll be measured on
- Establish ramp timeline and expectations
- Create month-by-month goals

**Month 1 (Onboarding)**:
- Complete product training
- Shadow 5-10 of your customer calls
- Do mock discovery calls and demos
- Learn the pitch deck and demo script
- First solo meetings by week 3-4

**Month 2 (Early Activity)**:
- 10-20 first meetings booked
- 50%+ convert to second meetings
- Active CRM usage and pipeline building

**Month 3 (Pipeline Development)**:
- Continue 10-20 first meetings
- Deals advancing to proposal stage
- First closes possible (but not required)

**Month 4-6 (Proving Success)**:
- Consistent first meeting volume
- Stage conversions matching targets
- First wins occurring
- Win rate trending toward 15-20%

### Step 8: Onboard with Founder as Sales Manager
- Founder/CEO must be the sales manager initially
- Sit with reps (in-person strongly recommended)
- Listen to every call in the first month
- Provide real-time coaching and feedback
- Update playbook based on their questions

**Onboarding activities**:
- Day 1-3: Product immersion, ICP training, playbook review
- Week 1: Shadow 5+ founder calls
- Week 2: Role-play discovery and demos, founder shadows their first calls
- Week 3-4: Increasing independence, daily feedback sessions
- Month 2+: Weekly 1:1s, call reviews, pipeline reviews

### Step 9: Monitor Leading Indicators Closely
Track these metrics weekly:
- First meetings booked
- First → Second meeting conversion rate
- Second → Third meeting conversion rate
- Opportunities created
- Stage progression velocity
- Email/activity volume

**Early warning signs** (by timeframe):
- **Month 1**: Not booking enough first meetings, low activity
- **Month 2**: Poor first → second meeting conversion, not building pipeline
- **Month 3**: Deals stalling, not advancing to later stages
- **Month 4+**: No closes, win rate far below target

### Step 10: Make Fast Decisions Based on Data
- Use leading indicators to make decisions quickly
- Don't wait 9 months to realize it's not working
- If someone's not getting first meetings in month 1-2, address immediately
- If conversion rates are off by month 3, investigate deeply

**Decision framework**:
- **Month 1**: Activity problems → coaching and accountability
- **Month 2**: Conversion problems → more role-play, call review, coaching
- **Month 3**: Persistent issues → serious performance conversation
- **Month 4**: No improvement → likely not a fit, move on

**Success signals**:
- Meeting targets for first meetings
- Stage conversions matching or exceeding your rates
- Positive feedback from prospects
- Self-sufficient behavior and problem-solving
- First wins by month 4-6

## Expected Outcomes
- 2-3 sellers onboarded and ramping
- At least 1-2 proving they can replicate founder's success
- Validation that your sales motion works for others
- Refined playbook based on new rep questions
- Foundation to scale to 4-8 reps next
- Clear understanding of what "good" looks like in your context

## Common Pitfalls
- **Hiring just one rep**: No comparison data, can't tell if it's the person or the playbook that's failing
- **Hiring VP of Sales too early**: They haven't sold recently, expect infrastructure you don't have, expensive mistake
- **Hiring too senior**: Senior reps expect polished materials and established processes
- **Wrong ICP experience**: Hiring someone who sold to CFOs when you sell to engineers - different skill set
- **Insufficient onboarding**: Handing them the playbook and saying "good luck" without active coaching
- **Remote onboarding**: For junior reps especially, remote dramatically slows learning loops
- **Ignoring leading indicators**: Waiting months to see closed deals before realizing there's a problem
- **No documentation**: Hiring before you've codified your sales motion
- **Premature scaling**: Going from 2 reps to 10 reps before proving 2 can succeed

## AI Integration Notes
Context signals that should trigger this SOP:
- User has done 20-30+ sales themselves
- User asks when to hire first salesperson
- User mentions hiring a VP of Sales for first hire
- User asks about remote vs. in-person for sales team
- User mentions sales hire not working out

How to adapt for different situations:
- **Very early stage**: If under 20 customers, redirect to founder-led sales first
- **High-velocity sales**: May need to hire SDRs + AEs together
- **Complex enterprise**: May need longer ramp expectations (9-12 months)
- **PLG motion**: May hire "product-led sales" specialists instead of traditional AEs
- **International**: Consider local market experience for first hires in region

Limitations and edge cases:
- Some founders may have enough capital to hire more than 2-3 initially (still don't go above 5)
- Highly specialized industries may require domain experts as sellers
- Very technical products may need sales engineers alongside AEs
- Some markets have limited talent pools - may need to train vs. hire experienced
