# Founder-Led Sales Methodology

## Metadata
- **Source**: Pete Kazanjy - Lenny's Podcast
- **Domain**: Sales
- **Type**: Framework
- **Applicable To**: B2B Founders, First-time sellers, Technical founders (Pre-seed to Series A)
- **Difficulty**: Beginner to Intermediate

## Overview
Founder-led sales is the practice of founders conducting sales themselves for the first 10-30+ customers before hiring salespeople. This approach ensures founders understand the sales motion, validate product-market fit, and create a repeatable process that can be packaged and taught to future sales hires.

## When to Use
- You have validated the problem through customer development and built a minimum viable product
- You need to prove that customers will pay for your solution
- You're ready to move beyond friendly/reference customers to arm's-length prospects
- You're building a B2B company and need to establish product-market fit
- Before hiring your first salesperson

## Prerequisites
- Validated problem through customer research
- Minimum viable product built and functional
- Clear understanding of the problem you're solving
- Willingness to have uncomfortable conversations with strangers
- Basic CRM setup to track conversations

## Procedure

### Step 1: Accept That You Must Do This Yourself
- Recognize that you cannot outsource early sales to a third party
- Understand that it's easier for you to learn minimum viable selling than for a salesperson to become an expert in your domain
- Remember: "Startups vs. incumbents is a race between can innovation get to distribution before distribution can get to innovation"
- Acknowledge that this is not optional for B2B success - founders must do the first 20-30 sales themselves

### Step 2: Overcome Sales Mindset Barriers
- Shift from deep work (engineering/PM) to contact switching (sales)
- Prepare to meet multiple new people every day instead of working with the same team
- Embrace activity orientation over maker schedules
- Accept that you'll need to write everything down in your CRM
- Develop rapid rapport-building skills through practice

**Practice exercises**:
- "Turbo rapport": Practice breaking down shields with bartenders, baristas, flight attendants - people who expect negative interactions
- Make eye contact with everyone on the street
- Strike up conversations at coffee shops or crosswalks (don't use weather - that's lazy)
- Focus on complimenting specific things (shirt, shoes) to start conversations

### Step 3: Build Your Sales Motion in Iterative Cohorts
- Start with cohorts of 10 first meetings, not 100 at once
- After each cohort, analyze what worked and what didn't
- Update your "source code" (slides, scripts, email templates) based on learnings
- Iterate constantly: Prospect → Meet → Learn → Update → Repeat

**Key metrics to track**:
- First meeting → Second meeting conversion (target: 70%)
- Second meeting → Third meeting conversion (target: ~65%)
- Overall opportunity → Win conversion (target: 15-25%)

### Step 4: Document Everything as You Learn
- Create slides to handle common objections as they arise
- Write down discovery questions that evoke good responses
- Document your demo script
- Build email templates for different stages
- Record your learnings in templates, not just in your head
- Think of your sales motion as software that needs constant updates

### Step 5: Achieve Statistical Significance
- Take 50-100 at-bats with arm's-length prospects (not friends, family, or accelerator members)
- Aim for 15-25% win rate as your target
- Ensure you can reliably turn cohorts of 10 first meetings into 1.5-2.5 customers
- Don't hire salespeople until this pattern is proven and repeatable

### Step 6: Package Your Knowledge
- Consolidate all slides, scripts, email templates, and discovery questions into transferable assets
- Create a documented sales motion that can be taught
- Prepare materials that will go into the brains of your first sales hires
- Ensure your pitch deck, demo script, and objection handlers are polished

## Expected Outcomes
- 15-25% win rate on arm's-length prospects
- Repeatable sales motion that works consistently across cohorts
- Deep understanding of customer pain points and how they buy
- Clear ICP (Ideal Customer Profile) definition
- Packaged sales knowledge ready to transfer to first hires
- Product improvements informed by direct customer feedback

## Common Pitfalls
- **Outsourcing too early**: Hiring a VP of sales or salesperson before achieving your own success leads to the "startups fire their first VP of sales" problem. You lose the feedback loop and play telephone with prospects.
- **Insufficient sample size**: Closing 2 out of 10 deals and assuming it's repeatable. Take 50-100 at-bats to ensure statistical significance.
- **Batch processing vs. iterative learning**: Running 100 meetings then analyzing results instead of learning after each cohort of 10.
- **Selling to friendly parties only**: Sales to your mother-in-law, accelerator mates, or friends don't count as validation. You need arm's-length prospects.
- **Focusing only on lagging indicators**: Looking only at closed deals instead of leading indicators like second meetings, third meetings, and stage progressions.
- **Treating it as magic**: Believing you need to be a "born seller" instead of recognizing sales as a learnable skill through practice.

## AI Integration Notes
Context signals that should trigger this SOP:
- User mentions they're a technical founder building a B2B product
- User asks about when to hire first salesperson
- User expresses fear or discomfort about doing sales
- User wants to outsource sales immediately after building MVP

How to adapt for different situations:
- For very technical founders: Emphasize that sales is more learnable than domain expertise
- For PLG products: Note that sales still becomes necessary, just later in the funnel
- For enterprise products: Emphasize longer sales cycles mean even more iterations needed

Limitations and edge cases:
- Consumer products may not need this approach
- Very technical developer tools with low price points might rely more heavily on PLG initially
- This framework assumes B2B sales motion, not applicable to B2C
