## Metadata
- **Source**: Jen Abel - Lenny's Podcast (Episodes 1 & 2)
- **Domain**: Sales / Hiring / Go-to-Market
- **Type**: Process & Framework
- **Applicable To**: Founders, early sales leaders ($500K-3M ARR)
- **Difficulty**: Intermediate to Advanced

## Overview
A systematic approach to transitioning from founder-led sales to a scalable sales team. This framework covers when to hire, who to hire, how to structure compensation, and how to ensure your first sales hires succeed without losing the founder's unique advantage in selling.

## When to Use
- You're at or approaching $1M ARR
- You have 7-10+ customers and clear patterns in your sales motion
- Your sales cycle is documented and repeatable
- You're spending 50%+ of your time on sales and it's limiting product development
- You have a 15-30% win rate consistently
- Investors are pushing you to hire sales
- You're confident in your ICP and messaging

## Prerequisites
- Minimum $500K ARR (ideally $1M ARR)
- 7-10 closed customers with clear patterns
- Documented sales playbook (see Sales Motion Discovery SOP)
- Clear ICP and qualification criteria
- Consistent win rate of 15-30%+
- Repeatable sales messaging
- Stable pricing and deal structure
- Founder availability to train and mentor

## Procedure

### Step 1: Determine WHEN to Hire (Timing Checklist)

**Goal**: Ensure you're ready to hire before you start recruiting.

**You're Ready to Hire If** (Must have at least 5 of 7):

- [ ] **Revenue Threshold**: $500K+ ARR (preferably $1M+)
  - Some say $500K, some say $1M
  - If you hit $500K really fast → you can hire
  - If you hit $500K really slow → wait, you haven't hit velocity yet

- [ ] **Customer Threshold**: 7-10+ closed customers
  - Need enough data to see patterns
  - Can articulate what these customers have in common

- [ ] **Win Rate Stability**: 15-30%+ win rate over 3+ months
  - This shows the motion works
  - Below 15% = still figuring it out

- [ ] **Founder Constraint**: Sales is taking 50%+ of founder's time
  - Preventing you from building product
  - Preventing you from fundraising
  - Preventing you from other critical CEO work

- [ ] **Repeatability**: You can explain your sales process to someone else
  - You have a documented playbook
  - You know which questions to ask when
  - You know what "good" looks like at each stage

- [ ] **Market Validation**: Consistent inbound interest OR healthy outbound conversion
  - Problem is clearly felt by market
  - Not just "sales problem" but real product-market fit signals

- [ ] **Funding/Runway**: Can afford sales hire(s) for 6-12 months
  - Typical enterprise AE: $150-200K OTE (50/50 split)
  - Need runway to let them ramp

**You're NOT Ready If**:
- Win rate is below 10% (this is a product/market problem, not a sales capacity problem)
- You can't explain why your best customers bought
- Sales process changes dramatically with each deal
- You're not sure who your ICP is
- Deals are closing because of founder magic, not a repeatable process

**Special Case - Series A Timing**:
> "I have this theory that maybe you shouldn't hire any salespeople until Series A, because seed is all about experimentation and proving out that experiment, and then obviously Series A is about exploiting that learning." - Jen Abel

### Step 2: Define Your Sales Hire Profile

**Goal**: Determine WHO to hire based on your sales motion and stage.

#### Option A: The "Cosplay Founder" Profile (RECOMMENDED)

**Characteristics**:
- Can vision cast (not just problem sell)
- Comfortable with ambiguity and incompleteness
- Excited by early-stage chaos
- Can think like a founder
- Comfortable talking to executives
- Adaptable and creative (not playbook-dependent)

**Backgrounds to Consider**:
1. **Former Founder** (Best option if you can get it)
   - Used to selling investors and employees
   - Comfortable with uncertainty
   - Can vision cast naturally
   - Resilient and scrappy

2. **Deep Product/Industry Expert** (Second best)
   - Domain expertise that buyers respect
   - Can have technical conversations
   - Brings fresh perspective (not "salesy")
   - Example: Engineer transitioning to sales

3. **Non-Traditional Sales Background**
   - Consultant who understands client problems
   - Customer success leader who knows how to build relationships
   - Product person who wants to get closer to customers

**Key Traits**:
- ✅ Do people WANT to buy from them? (Most important question)
- ✅ Do they mirror/match your target market? (Easier to sell to people like you)
- ✅ Are they excited about the problem you're solving?
- ✅ Can they articulate your value proposition after 2-3 conversations?
- ✅ Are they comfortable with "no sales experience" being an asset?

#### Option B: The Traditional Enterprise Sales Rep (USE CAREFULLY)

**When This Works**:
- You're selling to well-defined enterprise segment
- The sales motion is relatively standardized
- You need someone who knows how to navigate procurement
- Your product is mature enough

**Risks**:
- They may rely on "the brand" doing the work (which you don't have)
- They may fall back on playbook selling (kills the vibe)
- They may struggle with early-stage ambiguity
- They expect more support infrastructure than you have

**If Hiring This Profile**:
- ✅ Look for 3-5 years experience (not 15+ years)
- ✅ Avoid VPs from large companies (wrong game)
- ✅ Look for people who've been at startups before Series C
- ✅ Test if they can vision cast, not just problem sell

#### Red Flags in Sales Candidates

- ❌ **Needs extensive onboarding**: "What's the sales enablement team structure?"
- ❌ **Asks about brand/inbound**: Expects marketing to feed them leads
- ❌ **Resume shows only large companies**: Used to established brands selling
- ❌ **Can't explain why they're excited**: Just looking for any sales job
- ❌ **Overly focused on compensation**: Not mission-driven
- ❌ **Dismissive of founder involvement**: Doesn't want to learn from you
- ❌ **Too polished**: Enterprise polish doesn't work at early stage
- ❌ **Can't cold call**: Early stage requires outbound skills

### Step 3: Structure the Compensation Package

**Goal**: Create an incentive structure that aligns sales hire with company goals.

#### Standard Enterprise Sales Compensation Structure

**Base Structure: 50/50 OTE**
- 50% base salary
- 50% variable (commission/bonus)
- OTE (On-Target Earnings) = Base + Variable when hitting 100% of quota

**Example**:
```
OTE: $180,000
Base: $90,000
Variable: $90,000 (if quota hit)
```

**Commission Rate on Deals**:
- Typical: 8-12% of ACV (Annual Contract Value)
- Average: ~10% for technology companies
- Varies by deal size and complexity

**Example Commission Math**:
```
If quota is $1M in new ARR:
- 10% commission = $100K potential variable comp
- But adjust for ramp time (first 3-6 months typically lower quota)
```

#### Equity Component

**Typical Early Sales Hire Equity**:
- **First Sales Hire**: 0.25% - 1.0% (depends on stage and risk)
- **VP Sales**: 0.5% - 2.0%
- **4-year vesting with 1-year cliff** (standard)

**Considerations**:
- Earlier you hire = more equity needed (more risk)
- First sales hire at $500K ARR might get 0.75-1.0%
- Sales hire #3 at $2M ARR might get 0.1-0.25%

#### Quota Setting

**First Sales Hire Quota**:
- Ramp Period: 3-6 months at reduced quota (50-75% of full)
- Full Quota After Ramp: Typically $750K-1.5M in new ARR (for enterprise motion)
- Adjust based on:
  - Average deal size
  - Sales cycle length
  - Expected win rate

**Example Quota Ramp**:
```
Month 1-3: $0 quota (learning/onboarding)
Month 4-6: $150K quota (50% of full)
Month 7-12: $300K quota (100% of full)
Year 2: $400K+ quota (growth expectations)
```

#### Incentive Alignment Principles

**What Drives Sales Performance**:
> "Incentives. Salespeople love to make money. If they know it's possible, you'll be shocked what people can get done." - Jen Abel

**Structure Incentives to Drive Behavior**:
- Higher commission % for first deals (prove they can sell)
- Accelerators for over-quota performance (1.5x commission after 100%)
- SPIFs (Sales Performance Incentive Funds) for strategic deals
- Multi-year bonuses for retention/upsell

**What NOT to Do**:
- Don't pay commission on founder-sourced deals (they'll cherry-pick)
- Don't pay on services unless strategic (incentivizes wrong behavior)
- Don't create overly complex comp plans (confusion kills motivation)

### Step 4: Execute the Hiring Process

**Goal**: Find and close the right sales hire through a rigorous process.

#### Sourcing Candidates

**Where to Find Sales Talent**:
1. **Your Network** (Best source)
   - Ask your best customers: "Who's a great salesperson you've worked with?"
   - Ask investors for intros
   - Ask other founders in similar stage/market

2. **Recruiter/Headhunter** (Expensive but effective)
   - Worth it for first sales hire
   - They can filter for startup experience
   - Cost: 20-25% of first year comp

3. **Job Boards** (Lower hit rate)
   - AngelList, LinkedIn, etc.
   - Be very specific in job description
   - Expect 100+ applications, 2-3 good ones

4. **Poaching from Adjacent Startups**
   - Look at Series A/B companies in your space
   - Find #2-5 sales hire (not first, they may be worn out)
   - Offer equity upside of being earlier

#### Interview Process (4-5 Stages)

**Stage 1: Phone Screen (30 min)**
- Culture fit and motivation
- Why are they interested in early-stage?
- What excites them about the problem?
- Can they articulate your value prop after researching?

**Stage 2: Founder Interview (60 min)**
- Deep dive on sales philosophy
- How do they approach discovery?
- How do they handle objections?
- Can they vision cast vs. problem sell?
- **Key test**: Would you buy from this person?

**Stage 3: Mock Sales Call (45 min)**
- Give them materials 2 days ahead
- Have them pitch to you (role play as customer)
- Evaluate:
  - Do they ask good questions?
  - Do they listen?
  - Do they adapt to feedback?
  - Can they handle objections?
  - Do they create urgency without being pushy?

**Stage 4: Reference Checks (Multiple)**
- Talk to at least 3 references
- Ask: "Would you hire them again?"
- Ask: "What's their superpower in sales?"
- Ask: "Where do they struggle?"
- **Backchannel**: Find people who worked with them (not provided references)

**Stage 5: Founder "Shadow" Calls (Before Hire or First Week)**
- Have them join 3-5 of your sales calls
- Watch how they engage
- Do they take good notes?
- Do they ask good follow-up questions?
- Can they see what you see?

#### Red Flags in Interview Process

- ❌ Can't explain why they left last company
- ❌ Badmouths previous employers
- ❌ Doesn't ask questions about the product/market
- ❌ Focuses only on compensation in early conversations
- ❌ References are lukewarm or evasive
- ❌ Can't demonstrate curiosity in mock call
- ❌ Too slick or polished (doesn't feel authentic)

### Step 5: Onboard and Enable

**Goal**: Set your first sales hire up for success in first 90 days.

#### Month 1: Listening and Learning

**Week 1-2: Founder Shadow**
- Sales hire joins ALL founder sales calls
- Listens only (doesn't present)
- Takes detailed notes
- Debriefs after each call with founder

**Week 3-4: Founder + Rep Co-Selling**
- Founder leads, rep contributes
- Rep starts presenting parts of the pitch
- Founder provides real-time feedback
- Goal: Rep internalizes the motion

**Activities**:
- Customer interviews (talk to existing customers)
- Product deep-dive sessions
- ICP/persona workshops
- Review all previous deals (wins and losses)

**Success Metric**: Can they articulate your value prop better than you?

#### Month 2-3: Rep-Led with Founder Backup

**Week 5-8: Rep Leads, Founder Observes**
- Rep leads calls
- Founder sits in silently
- Debrief immediately after
- Founder steps in only if needed

**Week 9-12: Rep Flies Solo**
- Rep takes calls alone
- Async check-ins with founder
- Founder joins key calls (demos, closings)

**Activities**:
- Build own pipeline (outbound)
- Run full sales cycles solo
- Start closing deals independently
- Iterate on messaging and positioning

**Success Metric**: First deal closed independently

#### Ongoing Enablement

**Weekly 1:1s** (Throughout):
- Pipeline review
- Deal coaching
- Objection handling
- Wins and losses analysis

**Monthly Business Reviews**:
- Metrics review (activity, pipeline, conversions)
- What's working / not working
- Product feedback from the field
- Competitive intelligence

**Quarterly Planning**:
- Territory/account planning
- Quota setting
- Compensation adjustments
- Career development

### Step 6: Evaluate Performance and Iterate

**Goal**: Assess if the hire is working and make adjustments.

#### The "5 Calls Test"

> "You know after five calls if this person has what it takes." - Jen Abel

**After 5 Calls, Evaluate**:
- [ ] Are they asking the right questions?
- [ ] Do they represent the company well?
- [ ] Do they understand the value prop?
- [ ] Are they coachable? (Do they adapt based on feedback?)
- [ ] Do prospects engage with them?

**If NO on 3+: Probably not going to work out.**

#### 90-Day Performance Review

**Metrics to Evaluate**:
1. **Pipeline Created**: Did they build a healthy pipeline? (3-5x quota in pipeline)
2. **Activity Level**: Are they doing enough outreach? (Calls, emails, demos)
3. **Conversion Rates**: How do their rates compare to founder's baseline?
4. **Deal Quality**: Are they qualifying properly? (Not wasting time on bad fits)
5. **Cultural Fit**: Do they embody company values?
6. **Coachability**: Are they getting better each week?

**Outcome Scenarios**:

**Scenario A: Exceeding Expectations** (Rare but awesome)
- Closed 1-2 deals already
- Pipeline is healthy
- Conversion rates match or exceed founder's
- → Give them more autonomy, increase quota, accelerate plan

**Scenario B: On Track** (Most common if hire is good)
- Building pipeline steadily
- Had some good calls, some bad calls
- Learning and adapting
- → Stay the course, continue coaching

**Scenario C: Struggling** (Needs intervention)
- Not building pipeline
- Conversion rates way below baseline
- Not adapting to feedback
- → Intensive coaching, consider performance improvement plan

**Scenario D: Not Working** (Need to exit)
- Fundamental misalignment
- Not coachable
- Can't articulate value prop after 90 days
- → Let them go (failure rate is 50%+, don't drag it out)

#### The 50% Failure Rate Reality

> "One in every two salespeople usually are fired. It's a very high failure rate." - Jen Abel

**Why Sales Hiring Has High Failure Rate**:
- Hard to evaluate sales skills in interview
- Early-stage selling is very different from later-stage
- Many salespeople rely on brand/inbound
- Cultural misfit common
- Founder's vision is hard to transfer

**Mitigation Strategy**:
- **Hire two salespeople initially** (Jason Lemkin advice)
- One will likely succeed, one will likely fail
- You can compare performance
- Reduces single-person risk
- Creates healthy competition

**When to Fire**:
- After 90 days if no improvement
- If they can't close a deal in 6 months
- If they're actively hurting the brand
- If they're not coachable
- **Don't wait**: Dragging out a bad hire is worse than moving on

### Step 7: Scale from 1 to 2 to N

**Goal**: Once first hire is successful, systematically scale the team.

#### When to Hire Sales Rep #2

**Signals You're Ready**:
- First rep is consistently hitting quota (3+ months)
- Pipeline is healthy and growing
- You have more qualified leads than first rep can handle
- Founder is no longer needed on every call
- First rep has validated/improved the playbook

#### Building a Scalable Sales Org

**Typical Scaling Path**:
```
$0-1M ARR: Founder-led
$1-3M ARR: Founder + 1-2 AEs
$3-5M ARR: Founder + 3-5 AEs (consider Sales Manager)
$5-10M ARR: VP Sales + 5-10 AEs + SDRs
$10M+ ARR: Full sales org with specialization
```

**Specialization Path**:
1. First hires: AEs (Account Executives) who do everything
2. Then: SDRs (Sales Development Reps) for prospecting/qualification
3. Then: AEs focus only on closing
4. Then: Customer Success for retention/expansion
5. Then: Sales Engineers for technical pre-sales (if needed)

**Key Principle**: Don't over-hire ahead of need. Each hire should be painful (you desperately need them).

## Expected Outcomes

After successfully executing this transition:

- **Successful first sales hire** contributing to revenue within 3-6 months
- **Founder time freed up** to focus on product, fundraising, or other priorities
- **Validated and improved sales playbook** from new perspectives
- **Confidence in hiring more sales** based on first hire's success
- **Predictable sales pipeline** that doesn't depend solely on founder
- **Faster growth** from having multiple people selling
- **Better product insights** from sales team's customer conversations

**Timeline Expectations**:
- Month 1-3: Ramp and learning (low/no revenue)
- Month 4-6: First deals closing (50% of quota)
- Month 7-12: Full performance (100% of quota)
- Year 2: Exceeding quota and training others

## Common Pitfalls

### Pitfall 1: Hiring Too Early
**Problem**: Hiring a salesperson before you've figured out the sales motion.

**Why It Fails**:
- They have no playbook to follow
- You don't know what "good" looks like
- It becomes a game of telephone ("salesperson says no one cares")
- Founder blames salesperson, salesperson blames product
- Waste of time and money

**Solution**: Wait until $500K-1M ARR and 7-10 customers minimum.

### Pitfall 2: Hiring a VP of Sales from Big Company
**Problem**: Bringing in an experienced VP from a well-known brand.

**Why It Fails**:
- They're used to brand doing the heavy lifting
- They're used to extensive support (enablement, marketing, etc.)
- They expect a mature playbook
- They're playing the wrong game (scale vs. discovery)

**Solution**: Hire someone with startup experience (Series A/B companies), not late-stage or public company experience.

### Pitfall 3: Hiring Only One Salesperson
**Problem**: Putting all eggs in one basket with your first sales hire.

**Why It Fails**:
- 50% failure rate means coin flip on success
- If they fail, you're 6-12 months behind
- No comparison point (are they bad or is it the market?)
- Creates single point of failure

**Solution**: Hire two salespeople (Jason Lemkin's advice) - one will likely work out, and you can compare.

### Pitfall 4: Not Involving Founder Enough
**Problem**: Hiring a salesperson and immediately stepping away from sales.

**Why It Fails**:
- They can't learn your unique insight/vision
- They miss the "founder magic"
- They don't understand what resonates
- Deals that should close don't (founder could have saved them)

**Solution**: Founder MUST join first 20-30 calls with new sales hire. Shadow → Co-sell → Observe → Spot-join.

### Pitfall 5: Paying Commission on Founder-Sourced Deals
**Problem**: Paying sales rep commission on deals the founder brought in.

**Why It Fails**:
- Incentivizes rep to cherry-pick founder's leads
- Rep doesn't build own pipeline
- Creates conflict/resentment
- Rep never learns to hunt

**Solution**: Only pay commission on deals the rep sources themselves. Founder deals can have small "support bonus" but not full commission.

### Pitfall 6: Overly Complex Compensation Plans
**Problem**: Creating elaborate commission structures with multiple tiers, accelerators, and rules.

**Why It Fails**:
- Salespeople can't understand how much they'll make
- Confusion kills motivation
- Creates friction and disputes
- Hard to administer

**Solution**: Keep it simple. 50/50 base/variable, 10% commission on ACV, clear quota. Add complexity only when necessary.

### Pitfall 7: Not Firing Fast Enough
**Problem**: Keeping a struggling salesperson for 9-12 months hoping they improve.

**Why It Fails**:
- Sunk cost fallacy
- They're actively hurting the brand
- They're demotivating the founder and team
- Opportunity cost (could have hired someone better)

**Solution**: 90 days to show promise, 6 months to close a deal. If not, move on. Failure rate is 50%+ - don't fight it.

## Key Metrics to Track

**Sales Hire Performance Metrics**:
- **Pipeline Created**: 3-5x quota in qualified pipeline
- **Activity Level**: Calls, emails, demos per week
- **Conversion Rates**: Response rate, call booking rate, demo-to-proposal, proposal-to-close
- **Win Rate**: Closed deals / qualified opportunities (should match founder's baseline)
- **Quota Attainment**: % of quota hit each month/quarter
- **Deal Size**: Average ACV (should match or exceed founder's deals)
- **Sales Cycle**: Days from first touch to close (should match or beat founder's)

**Team Metrics** (Once you have multiple reps):
- **Team Quota Attainment**: % of team hitting quota (target: 60%+)
- **New ARR Added**: Total new revenue from sales team
- **CAC (Customer Acquisition Cost)**: Cost to acquire customer (should be < 1/3 of LTV)
- **Sales Efficiency**: New ARR / Sales team cost (target: 3-5x)

## AI Integration Notes

**Context Signals for AI Models**:
- User mentions "should I hire a salesperson?" or "when to hire sales?"
- User is at $500K-1M ARR or has 7-10 customers
- User says "founder is spending all time on sales"
- User mentions "need to scale sales" or "can't keep up with demand"
- User asks about "sales comp structure" or "how much to pay sales"

**Adaptation Guidance**:
- For PLG companies: This transition happens much later (after PLG ceiling is hit)
- For Enterprise-focused: May need to hire earlier and pay higher comp
- For SMB-focused: May hire SDRs before AEs (different motion)
- For technical products: May need Sales Engineers before AEs
- For international markets: Comp structures vary significantly by region

**Limitations**:
- Assumes you're in B2B SaaS (other models differ significantly)
- Comp numbers are US-based (adjust for other markets)
- Timeline assumes typical sales cycle (adjust for very long or very short cycles)
- Assumes founder has been successful at selling (if not, may need consulting/coaching first)

**Diagnostic Questions to Ask Users**:
- What's your current ARR?
- How many customers do you have?
- What's your average deal size?
- What's your win rate?
- How much time is the founder spending on sales?
- Do you have a documented sales playbook?
- Have you tried hiring a salesperson before?
