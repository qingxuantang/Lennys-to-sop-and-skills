# Sales Motion Discovery Framework

## Metadata
- **Source**: Jen Abel - Lenny's Podcast (Episodes 1 & 2)
- **Domain**: Sales / Go-to-Market Strategy
- **Type**: Framework
- **Applicable To**: Founders, early sales hires, GTM leaders (500K - 3M ARR)
- **Difficulty**: Intermediate

## Overview
A systematic approach to discovering and documenting your repeatable sales motion through experimentation and pattern recognition. This framework helps you transition from ad-hoc founder-led sales to a scalable, teachable sales process that can be handed off to your first sales hires.

## When to Use
- You have 7-10 customers and are looking for patterns
- You're approaching $500K-1M ARR and need to scale
- You want to hire your first salesperson but don't know what to teach them
- Your sales process feels inconsistent or unrepeatable
- You're trying to understand what "good" looks like in your sales process
- Investors are asking about your "sales playbook"

## Prerequisites
- At least 7-10 closed customers
- Founder has been personally involved in most/all sales
- Basic understanding of your ICP (even if still evolving)
- Some form of CRM or tracking system
- Willingness to analyze wins and losses honestly

## Procedure

### Step 1: Document Your Existing Sales Stages

**Goal**: Map out the actual stages your deals go through (not theoretical stages).

**Analyze Your Last 10 Closed Deals**:

1. **List every touchpoint** from first contact to signed contract:
   - First outreach
   - Initial call
   - Demo/second call
   - Proposal/scope discussion
   - Co-authoring/refinement
   - Procurement (if applicable)
   - Signature

2. **Identify common patterns**:
   - Which stages appear in EVERY deal?
   - Which stages only appear sometimes?
   - Where do deals get stuck most often?
   - What are the average time gaps between stages?

3. **Create your baseline sales stages**:

   **Typical B2B SaaS Enterprise Sales Stages**:
   - **Stage 1**: Intro/Discovery Call (30 min)
   - **Stage 2**: Demo/Deep Dive (45-60 min)
   - **Stage 3**: Proposal/Scope of Work Presentation (30-45 min)
   - **Stage 4**: Co-authoring/Refinement (30 min)
   - **Stage 5**: Procurement Introduction (varies)
   - **Stage 6**: Post-Procurement Signature (async)

   **Note**: These stages will differ based on:
   - Deal size (< $10K vs $10-50K vs $50K+ vs $100K+)
   - Market segment (SMB vs Mid-Market vs Enterprise)
   - Product complexity (simple tool vs platform vs service)

### Step 2: Calculate Your Core Sales Metrics

**Goal**: Establish baseline metrics to understand your current performance.

**Essential Metrics to Calculate**:

1. **Conversion Rates by Stage**:
   ```
   Stage 1 → Stage 2: _____%
   Stage 2 → Stage 3: _____%
   Stage 3 → Stage 4: _____%
   Stage 4 → Closed: _____%
   Overall Win Rate: _____%
   ```

2. **Win Rate** (Most Important):
   ```
   Win Rate = Closed Customers / Total Qualified Opportunities
   Target: 15-30% for early stage
   ```

   **Why Win Rate Matters More Than Conversion Rate**:
   - High win rate (30%+) = You can afford lower conversion rates on outbound
   - Low win rate (< 10%) = You need massive top-of-funnel to hit targets
   - Measures quality of pipeline, not just quantity

3. **Sales Cycle Length**:
   ```
   Average Days from First Contact to Signed Contract: _____ days

   By Segment:
   - SMB (< 100 employees): Typically 30-90 days
   - Mid-Market (100-1K employees): Typically 60-120 days
   - Enterprise (1K+ employees): Typically 90-180 days (can be 6-12 months)
   ```

4. **Deal Velocity**:
   ```
   Average time between each stage:
   First Contact → First Call: _____ days
   First Call → Demo: _____ days
   Demo → Proposal: _____ days
   Proposal → Closed: _____ days
   ```

**Red Flags in Your Metrics**:
- Win rate < 10% → Qualification problem or product-market fit issue
- Sales cycle > 9 months for first deal → Selling to wrong level or deal size too small
- Conversion rates dropping at specific stage → Bottleneck identified
- High initial interest, low close rate → Messaging or qualification mismatch

### Step 3: Analyze Your Best vs. Worst Customers

**Goal**: Identify the characteristics of customers who close fast, pay well, and get value.

**Create Two Lists**:

**List A: Your 3 Best Customers**
- Who closed fastest?
- Who paid full price (or more)?
- Who is most engaged post-sale?
- Who refers other customers?

**List B: Your 3 Worst Customers**
- Who took forever to close?
- Who demanded deep discounts?
- Who churned or is at risk?
- Who consumes the most support resources?

**Compare Across These Dimensions**:

| Dimension | Best Customers | Worst Customers | Pattern? |
|-----------|---------------|-----------------|----------|
| Company Size | | | |
| Industry | | | |
| Title/Seniority of Buyer | | | |
| Budget Ownership | | | |
| Team Size Using Product | | | |
| Technical Maturity | | | |
| Previous Tools Used | | | |
| Initial Pain Level | | | |
| Deal Size | | | |
| Sales Cycle Length | | | |

**Key Insights to Extract**:
- What do your best customers have in common? (These are your TRUE ICP signals)
- What red flags predict a difficult sale? (These are disqualification criteria)
- Where should you focus your energy? (Double down on "best" profile)

### Step 4: Identify Your Unique Sales Motions

**Goal**: Discover if you have different sales motions for different segments.

**Recognize That Sales is NOT One-Size-Fits-All**:

You likely need different approaches for:

1. **SMB Sales Motion** (< $10K ACV):
   - High volume, low touch
   - Marketing-driven inbound
   - Self-serve or low-touch sales
   - Fast cycle (30-60 days)
   - Minimal customization

2. **Mid-Market Sales Motion** ($10-50K ACV):
   - Medium volume, medium touch
   - Mix of inbound and outbound
   - Sales-assisted with some automation
   - Medium cycle (60-120 days)
   - Some customization

3. **Enterprise Sales Motion** ($50K+ ACV, ideally $75-150K+):
   - Low volume, high touch
   - Outbound-driven, relationship-based
   - Fully customized, consultative
   - Long cycle (90-180+ days)
   - Heavy customization and co-creation

**IMPORTANT INSIGHT**: "The mid-market doesn't exist"

Per Jen Abel: The mid-market is a false category. You're either playing:
- **Upper-end SMB game** (more marketing-led, higher volume)
- **Lower-end Enterprise game** (more sales-led, higher touch)

Don't try to blend these - pick one game and play it well.

**Decision Framework**:
- Can you generate $100M+ revenue at this ACV? (Do the math)
- Are you a strong marketer or strong salesperson? (Play to strengths)
- What does your product economics support? (CAC:LTV ratio)

### Step 5: Define Your Qualification Criteria

**Goal**: Create a clear checklist to qualify or disqualify prospects early.

**Build Your Qualification Framework** (Adapt BANT/MEDDIC):

1. **Problem Validation**:
   - [ ] Is the problem growing/widening? (Not stable or shrinking)
   - [ ] Are they measuring or managing this problem today?
   - [ ] Have they tried to solve it before? (Budget allocation signal)
   - [ ] What's the cost of NOT solving it?

2. **Budget**:
   - [ ] Do they have budget allocated?
   - [ ] If not, can they create budget?
   - [ ] Are they comfortable with the price range? ($XK - $YK)

3. **Authority**:
   - [ ] Is this person the economic buyer?
   - [ ] If not, do they have access to the buyer?
   - [ ] Can they bring the buyer into the next call?
   - [ ] Will executive sign-off be required?

4. **Need**:
   - [ ] Is this a must-have or nice-to-have?
   - [ ] What happens if they don't solve this this year?
   - [ ] Are they willing to invest time in implementation?

5. **Timeline**:
   - [ ] When do they need this solved by?
   - [ ] Is there a forcing function? (Budget cycle, deadline, event)
   - [ ] Can they move through procurement in that timeline?

**Disqualification Signals** (The "No"):
- "We're just exploring" (no urgency)
- "I'll need to email you my calendar" (not engaged)
- Can't/won't bring stakeholders into calls (no authority)
- Want deep discount without giving anything in return (wrong customer)
- "What keeps you up at night?" gets vague answer (no clear problem)

**IMPORTANT**: "No is the best answer to yes" - Disqualify fast to focus on real opportunities.

### Step 6: Document Your Pitch Evolution

**Goal**: Understand how your messaging has evolved and what works now.

**Track Your Messaging Evolution**:

1. **Month 1 Pitch**: What did you say when you had no customers?
2. **Month 6 Pitch**: How did it change with some customers?
3. **Current Pitch**: What do you say now?

**Analyze What Changed**:
- Did you move from problem-focused to solution-focused? (Be careful - problem should stay central)
- Did you add social proof? (Customer logos, case studies)
- Did you simplify or complexify? (Simpler usually wins)
- Did you discover a better "hook"? (Counterintuitive insight)

**Current Winning Message Components**:

1. **For Outreach** (Cold Email/LinkedIn):
   - Relevance: _______________________
   - Counterintuitive Hook: _______________________
   - Problem Focus: _______________________
   - Call to Action: _______________________

2. **For First Call** (Discovery):
   - Opening (Vulnerability): _______________________
   - Vision Casting: _______________________
   - Key Questions: _______________________
   - Qualification: _______________________

3. **For Demo/Second Call**:
   - Context Setting: _______________________
   - Value Framing: _______________________
   - Storytelling: _______________________
   - Next Steps: _______________________

**Vision Casting vs. Problem Selling**:

❌ **Problem Selling** (Typical salespeople):
- "Here's your problem, here's our solution"
- Feature-focused
- Transactional

✅ **Vision Casting** (Founders):
- "Here's the opportunity/alpha you're missing"
- Outcome-focused
- Transformational
- Example: "You'll be able to hire 10X engineers who won't join without Cursor"

### Step 7: Map Your Procurement Process

**Goal**: Understand and document how deals get through legal/procurement (for enterprise).

**If Selling to Enterprise (typically $50K+ deals)**:

1. **Identify Common Procurement Stakeholders**:
   - Who is the business buyer? (Your champion)
   - Who is the economic buyer? (Budget owner)
   - Who is procurement? (Professional buyer)
   - Who is legal? (Contract reviewer)
   - Who is IT/Security? (Technical reviewer)
   - Who is the signatory? (Could be CFO, CLO, business unit head, procurement)

2. **Document Procurement Timelines**:
   - IT Security review: _____ days
   - Legal review: _____ days
   - Procurement negotiation: _____ days
   - Signature queue: _____ days
   - Total procurement time: _____ days (can add 30-90 days to deal)

3. **Procurement Success Tactics** (From Your Wins):
   - Do you provide filled-out forms proactively?
   - Do you offer to simplify contracts?
   - Do you explain exactly what you do AND don't do?
   - Do you split into service + technology contracts?
   - Do you know the signatory before entering procurement?

**Common Procurement Failure Modes**:
- Sending deal to procurement without executive support → Dies in queue
- Can't classify your product → Get kitchen-sink MSA (high insurance requirements, etc.)
- Signatory doesn't understand what they're signing → Kicks it back, lose queue position
- Don't know IT review timeline → Miss buyer's budget cycle

### Step 8: Create Your Handoff Document

**Goal**: Package everything into a document you can give to your first sales hire.

**Your Sales Playbook Should Include**:

1. **Target Customer Profile (ICP)**:
   - Company size: _______
   - Industry: _______
   - Title/role: _______
   - Indicators they're a good fit: _______
   - Disqualification criteria: _______

2. **Outreach Playbook**:
   - Cold email template
   - LinkedIn message template
   - Cold call script
   - Expected conversion rates
   - Follow-up cadence

3. **Sales Stages and Conversion Rates**:
   - Stage definitions
   - Typical timeline for each stage
   - Conversion rates between stages
   - What "good" looks like at each stage

4. **Call Structure and Questions**:
   - First call structure and questions
   - Demo call structure
   - Proposal call structure
   - Qualification framework

5. **Pricing and Deal Structure**:
   - Standard pricing: $_______
   - Typical deal size: $_______
   - When to discount (and how much)
   - Payment terms
   - Contract length

6. **Objection Handling**:
   - Common objections and responses
   - Competitive positioning
   - When to walk away

7. **Procurement Navigation**:
   - Typical stakeholders
   - Timeline expectations
   - How to make procurement easy
   - Red flags

## Expected Outcomes

After completing this framework:

- **Clear ICP definition** based on actual customer data (not assumptions)
- **Documented sales stages** with realistic timelines
- **Baseline metrics** (win rate, cycle length, conversion rates)
- **Qualification criteria** to focus time on best-fit prospects
- **Repeatable messaging** that you can teach to others
- **Playbook document** ready to hand to your first sales hire
- **Confidence about pricing** and deal structure
- **Understanding of your sales motion(s)** - SMB vs Enterprise

**Most Importantly**: You'll know if you're ready to hire or if you need more data.

## Common Pitfalls

### Pitfall 1: Codifying Too Early
**Problem**: Creating a playbook after 2-3 customers.

**Why It Fails**:
- Not enough data for patterns
- Early customers might not represent your true ICP
- Process isn't stable yet

**Solution**: Wait until 7-10 customers minimum. Better to have conviction than a premature playbook.

### Pitfall 2: Assuming One Size Fits All
**Problem**: Trying to use the same sales motion for a $5K SMB and a $150K Enterprise deal.

**Why It Fails**:
- Completely different buyer behaviors
- Different timelines and touchpoints
- Different economics (one needs volume, one needs value)
- Confuses your sales team

**Solution**: Define distinct motions for distinct segments. Don't blend SMB and Enterprise games.

### Pitfall 3: Copying Someone Else's Playbook
**Problem**: Using a template from a sales book or another company.

**Why It Fails**:
- Every company's sales motion is unique
- What works for Salesforce doesn't work for your startup
- You skip the learning process
- Your sales team has no context for why things are done a certain way

**Solution**: Document YOUR actual motion based on YOUR actual deals.

### Pitfall 4: Focusing on Conversion Rate Over Win Rate
**Problem**: Obsessing over "response rate to cold emails" while ignoring "close rate from qualified opportunities."

**Why It Fails**:
- High conversion + low win rate = Waste of time
- You can afford low conversion if win rate is high
- Conversion is about volume, win rate is about quality

**Solution**: Optimize win rate first. Then worry about conversion rate to feed a proven machine.

### Pitfall 5: Not Tracking Lost Deals
**Problem**: Only analyzing wins, not losses.

**Why It Fails**:
- You don't learn from failures
- Can't identify patterns in objections
- Miss opportunities to improve qualification

**Solution**: After every lost deal, document:
- Why did we lose?
- What red flags did we miss?
- Should we have disqualified earlier?
- What can we learn?

### Pitfall 6: Confusing Politeness with Interest
**Problem**: Thinking "they said it was great" means "they'll buy."

**Why It Fails**:
- People are nice and don't want to reject founders
- Positive words ≠ buying intent
- Actions speak louder than words

**Solution**: Look for behaviors:
- Do they schedule follow-ups immediately?
- Do they bring in stakeholders?
- Do they ask detailed questions?
- Do they move quickly through stages?

## Key Metrics to Track

**Sales Efficiency Metrics**:
- **Win Rate**: Closed / Qualified Opps (Target: 15-30%)
- **Sales Cycle Length**: Days from first touch to close
- **Average Deal Size**: Mean and median ACV
- **Stage Conversion Rates**: % moving from each stage to next
- **Velocity**: How fast deals move through stages

**Segmentation Metrics**:
- Win rate by customer size
- Win rate by industry
- Sales cycle by segment
- Deal size by segment

**Leading Indicators**:
- Qualified opportunities created per month
- Demo-to-proposal conversion rate
- Proposal-to-close conversion rate
- Time to first call scheduled

## AI Integration Notes

**Context Signals for AI Models**:
- User mentions having "7-10 customers" or "approaching $1M ARR"
- User asks "should I hire a salesperson?"
- User says "sales process feels inconsistent"
- User mentions "investors asking for sales playbook"
- User expresses confusion about which market segment to target

**Adaptation Guidance**:
- For PLG companies: Sales motion discovery is less relevant until hitting PLG ceiling
- For Enterprise-only: Focus heavily on Step 7 (procurement mapping)
- For SMB-only: Focus heavily on automation and efficiency (less on customization)
- For API/developer products: Sales motion might be primarily product-led or partner-led

**Limitations**:
- This framework assumes you have enough customers to see patterns (7-10 minimum)
- Doesn't apply to pure PLG models (though hybrid PLG-sales models can use it)
- Assumes founder has been deeply involved in sales (can't discover motion you haven't run)
- Metrics and timelines vary dramatically by industry and product type

**Diagnostic Questions to Ask Users**:
- How many customers do you have?
- What's your current ARR?
- What's your average deal size?
- How long is your sales cycle?
- What's your win rate?
- Are you selling to SMB, mid-market, or enterprise?
- Is the founder still doing all sales, or have you hired?
