# Sales Team Scaling Framework

## Metadata
- **Source**: Pete Kazanjy - Lenny's Podcast
- **Domain**: Sales
- **Type**: Framework
- **Applicable To**: B2B Founders, Sales Leaders, VPs of Sales (Series A to Series B+)
- **Difficulty**: Intermediate to Advanced

## Overview
Scaling a B2B sales team follows a predictable pattern: 1 → 2 → 4 → 8 → 16 → 32. Each stage must be successful before moving to the next. Skipping stages leads to failure. This framework outlines how to scale methodically using leading indicators, stage-gated growth, and data-driven management.

## When to Use
- You've successfully hired and ramped your first 2-3 sellers
- Your reps are achieving similar win rates to the founder (15-25%)
- You have consistent pipeline generation and predictable conversions
- You need to grow revenue and are ready to scale the team
- You have refined sales playbook that works across multiple sellers

## Prerequisites
- At least 2 successful salespeople already ramped
- Documented and validated sales playbook
- CRM infrastructure with reliable data
- Sales manager in place (founder initially, dedicated manager by 4-8 reps)
- Proven unit economics (CAC, LTV, payback period)
- Capital to fund team growth

## Procedure

### Step 1: Understand the B2B Maturity Journey Stages
Recognize that you must progress through these stages in order:
1. **Founder sells successfully** (20-30+ customers, 15-25% win rate)
2. **Package the sales motion** (create playbook)
3. **2-3 reps replicate founder's success** (similar win rates)
4. **Hire sales manager, scale to 4-8 reps**
5. **Segment/specialize (if needed), scale to 16-32 reps**
6. **Add management layers, scale to 64+ reps**

**Critical rule**: Never skip a stage. If you jump from stage 1 to stage 4, you will fail.

### Step 2: Define Success Criteria for Each Stage
Only advance to the next stage when current stage success is proven.

**Stage: First 2 reps (Post-founder)**
Success criteria:
- Both reps at 15-20% win rate or better
- Meeting activity targets (10-20 first meetings per month)
- Stage conversions matching founder's rates
- Consistently closing deals
- Ramp time under 6 months
- Playbook validated across multiple sellers

**Stage: 4-8 reps**
Success criteria:
- At least 50% of reps hitting quota
- Dedicated sales manager in place
- Consistent month-over-month growth
- Refined onboarding process (under 4 months to productivity)
- Predictable pipeline generation

**Stage: 8-16 reps**
Success criteria:
- Manager:rep ratio at 1:6-8
- Potential specialization (SDRs + AEs, or geographic/vertical teams)
- Multiple cohorts of reps successfully ramped
- Sales ops function established
- Data-driven forecasting

**Stage: 16+ reps**
Success criteria:
- Manager of managers structure
- Specialized roles (SDRs, AEs, SEs, CSMs)
- Territory/segment alignment
- Formal enablement function
- Advanced analytics and instrumentation

### Step 3: Scale Incrementally - Double When Ready
- Use the doubling pattern: 2 → 4 → 8 → 16 → 32
- Wait for success before doubling
- Don't hire 10 reps when you only have 2 successful

**Why doubling works**:
- Manageable span of control
- Easier to onboard smaller cohorts
- Can identify issues before they multiply
- Preserves culture and quality
- Allows time to update playbook and processes

**Timing between doublings**:
- 2 → 4 reps: After 6 months of success with first 2
- 4 → 8 reps: After 3-4 months of success with 4
- 8 → 16 reps: After 1-2 quarters of success with 8
- 16 → 32 reps: After 1-2 quarters of success with 16

### Step 4: Hire Sales Manager at 4-8 Reps
- Don't hire manager too early (not needed for 2 reps)
- Don't wait too long (founder can't manage 8+ effectively)
- Target: Hire manager when you're ready to go from 4 → 8

**Manager profile at this stage**:
- Has been a successful seller recently (within 2 years)
- Experience managing 4-8 reps at early-stage company
- Not too far removed from carrying a quota
- Willing to be hands-on and coach daily
- Comfortable with ambiguity and building process
- Example: Marissa Fuhrer type (Dropbox → Figma, seller → manager)

**Manager responsibilities**:
- Onboard new reps
- Daily/weekly coaching
- Call and email reviews
- Pipeline management
- Forecast management
- Playbook iteration
- Performance management

### Step 5: Instrument Everything - Leading Indicators Focus
Implement data-driven sales management using leading indicators.

**Leading indicators to track** (by rep, by team):
- First meetings booked per week
- First → Second meeting conversion %
- Second → Third meeting conversion %
- Opportunities created per month
- Stage progression velocity
- Email volume and response rates
- Calendar utilization (meeting density)
- Activity levels (calls, emails, tasks)

**Why leading indicators matter**:
- See problems in weeks, not months
- Coach to activities, not just results
- Identify skill gaps quickly
- Predict future results
- Make faster hiring/firing decisions

**Lagging indicators** (still important):
- Opportunities → Closed-won %
- Average selling price (ASP)
- Sales cycle length
- Monthly bookings per rep
- Quota attainment

### Step 6: Perfect Onboarding Before Scaling Further
- Document what works in onboarding your first reps
- Create structured onboarding program
- Reduce ramp time with each cohort
- Don't scale until ramp is predictable

**Onboarding optimization**:
- Week-by-week plan for first 90 days
- Product training curriculum
- Mock call library
- Recorded demos to study
- Shadowing rotation
- Gradual responsibility increase
- Clear metrics for each month

**Ramp time targets**:
- First 2 reps: 4-6 months to full productivity
- Next 2-4 reps: 3-4 months to full productivity
- At scale (16+ reps): 2-3 months to full productivity

### Step 7: Optimize for Co-location (Especially for Junior Reps)
- Prioritize in-person for early-stage teams
- Seat reps together for peer learning
- Manager should sit with the team
- Enable real-time coaching

**Why in-person matters early**:
- Faster feedback loops (immediate vs. async)
- Peer learning through osmosis
- Manager can listen to all calls simultaneously
- Faster correction cycles
- Accountability and culture building

**Remote considerations**:
- Experienced reps (5+ years) can work remote more effectively
- Field sales roles naturally remote
- But for junior reps and early team, strongly prefer co-located
- If remote required, over-invest in synchronous coaching and call reviews

### Step 8: Segment and Specialize as You Scale
- Early stage (2-8 reps): Everyone does everything
- Mid stage (8-16 reps): Consider SDR/AE split
- Later stage (16+ reps): Add specialization

**Specialization options**:
- **Role-based**: SDRs (prospecting) + AEs (closing) + SEs (technical)
- **Geographic**: West, East, International teams
- **Vertical**: Industry-specific teams
- **Deal size**: SMB vs. Mid-market vs. Enterprise

**When to specialize**:
- SDRs: When outbound is significant and AEs are capacity-constrained
- Geographic: When you have 3+ reps in a region
- Vertical: When you have distinct ICPs with different sales motions
- Deal size: When ASP varies by 5-10x across customer segments

### Step 9: Add Sales Operations Function
- Start with founder doing ops for first 2 reps
- Add part-time ops by 4-8 reps
- Hire full-time sales ops at 8-16 reps

**Sales ops responsibilities**:
- CRM administration and hygiene
- Reporting and dashboards
- Comp plan management
- Territory/account assignment
- Tool stack management
- Data quality and integrity
- Process documentation

### Step 10: Implement Modern Sales Management Tools
- Invest in sales analytics beyond basic CRM
- Add conversation intelligence (Gong, Chorus)
- Implement sales engagement platforms (Outreach, Salesloft)
- Use data to manage, not just gut feel

**Analytics to implement**:
- Activity tracking and benchmarking
- Stage conversion analysis
- Win/loss analysis
- Rep performance dashboards
- Forecast accuracy tracking
- Pipeline coverage ratios

**When to invest**:
- Basic CRM (Salesforce, HubSpot): From day 1
- Sales analytics (Atrium, Clari): At 4-8 reps
- Conversation intelligence: At 8-16 reps
- Sales engagement: At 8-16 reps

## Expected Outcomes
- Predictable, scalable sales growth
- Consistent rep performance (50%+ hitting quota)
- Shortened ramp times with each cohort
- Data-driven culture in sales organization
- Foundation to scale to 100+ reps if needed
- Reduced sales leadership turnover
- Efficient use of capital (avoid premature scaling waste)

## Common Pitfalls
- **Skipping stages**: Going from founder to 10 reps without validating 2-3 first. This is the #1 reason startups "fire their first VP of sales."
- **Hiring manager too early**: Bringing in manager before you have 2-3 successful reps to learn from.
- **Scaling before playbook**: Hiring more reps before documenting what works.
- **Ignoring leading indicators**: Only looking at closed deals, missing early warning signs.
- **Remote-only for junior reps**: Dramatically slower learning loops for early-career sellers.
- **Batch hiring too many**: Hiring 8 reps at once when you've only successfully ramped 2.
- **No specialization at scale**: Having 30 reps all doing full-cycle sales instead of SDR/AE model.
- **Wrong manager profile**: Hiring someone who hasn't sold in 5+ years to manage 4 early reps.
- **Premature VP hire**: Bringing in experienced VP before proving model works with multiple reps.

## AI Integration Notes
Context signals that should trigger this SOP:
- User has 2+ successful sales reps and wants to scale
- User asks how many salespeople to hire
- User mentions wanting to hire a large sales team quickly
- User's first sales hires are successful and they're ready for next stage
- User asks when to hire sales manager
- User asks about SDR vs. AE model

How to adapt for different situations:
- **High-velocity SMB sales**: May scale faster (monthly doublings possible)
- **Enterprise sales**: May scale slower (6-month doublings more appropriate)
- **PLG to sales**: May start with product-led sales specialists before traditional AEs
- **International expansion**: May need to build regional teams in parallel
- **Vertical SaaS**: May specialize by vertical earlier (at 4-8 reps instead of 16+)

Limitations and edge cases:
- Some companies may have capital to scale faster - still shouldn't skip validation stages
- Market timing may require faster scaling (competitive dynamics) - increase risk tolerance but don't abandon framework entirely
- Very experienced sales leaders may be able to manage larger first teams (10-12) but still risky
- Developer tools with PLG motion may not need SDRs even at scale
- This framework assumes new logo acquisition - expansion/account management may scale differently
