# Customer Value First Principles Framework

## Metadata
- **Source**: Stewart Butterfield - Lenny's Podcast
- **Domain**: Strategy / Company Culture / Leadership
- **Type**: Framework
- **Applicable To**: Founders, CEOs, Product Leaders, All employees (All stages)
- **Difficulty**: Beginner (concept) / Advanced (implementation)

## Overview
A foundational company philosophy that makes customer value creation the ultimate measure of success, implemented through explicit cultural reinforcement, decision-making criteria, and policy choices. This framework, used at both Flickr and Slack, establishes that long-term success is impossible without genuinely creating value for customers—not just demonstrating value, but actually creating it.

## When to Use
- Setting company values and culture (especially early stage)
- Making product decisions with competing priorities
- Evaluating pricing and monetization strategies
- Designing customer policies (SLAs, refunds, terms of service)
- Resolving conflicts between short-term revenue and customer experience
- Hiring and performance evaluation (cultural fit)
- All-hands meetings and team alignment moments

## Prerequisites
- Leadership commitment to genuinely prioritize customers (not just lip service)
- Willingness to make short-term sacrifices for long-term customer relationships
- Ability to measure or understand customer value creation
- Company stage where culture can still be shaped (easier early, possible at any stage)

## Procedure

### Step 1: Establish the Core Principle Explicitly
**Make customer value creation the stated measure of success**

- **The Core Mantra**:
  "In the long run, the measure of our success will be the amount of value that we create for customers."

- **Critical Addition**:
  "You can put effort into demonstrating that you have created this value and stuff like that, but there's no substitute for actually having created it."

**Key Quote**: "At more than one company all hands, I made everyone in the company repeat this as a chant. It was, 'In the long run, the measure of our success will be the amount of value we create for customers.'"

- **Implementation Method**:
  - Introduce at company all-hands meetings
  - Have entire company recite together (creates shared commitment)
  - Repeat regularly (not just once)
  - Put on walls, swag, company materials
  - Reference in decision-making moments

- **Why the Chant Ritual Works**:
  - Public commitment (everyone hears everyone else commit)
  - Memorable and repeatable
  - Creates cultural anchor point
  - Feels slightly uncomfortable (which makes it memorable)
  - "It felt very like, Kim Jong-un or Stalin or something like that"—but effective

### Step 2: Distinguish Value Creation from Value Communication
**Understand the hierarchy: Create value first, communicate it second**

- **The Hierarchy**:
  1. **Actually creating value** (fundamental requirement)
  2. Demonstrating/communicating that value (marketing, sales, positioning)
  3. Capturing portion of that value (monetization, pricing)

- **Common Mistake**: Focusing on #2 and #3 before achieving #1
  - Spending on marketing before product creates real value
  - Complex sales processes to convince customers rather than building obviously valuable product
  - Aggressive monetization of mediocre product

- **The Truth**:
  "You can't destroy value for your customers and expect to be successful. You have to actually make their lives better."

- **Diagnostic Questions**:
  - If we stopped all marketing, would customers still recommend us?
  - If we removed our sales team, would customers still buy?
  - Do users genuinely miss our product when it's unavailable?
  - Would customers pay more than we're charging if we asked?
  - Do churned customers say the product wasn't valuable or just couldn't afford it?

### Step 3: Apply to Policy and Business Decisions
**Use customer value as decision-making criteria**

- **Framework for Every Decision**:
  1. What would maximize customer value?
  2. What would maximize company revenue/profit?
  3. If these conflict, can we find a third way that serves both?
  4. If not, default to customer value (with rare exceptions for survival)

- **Example Applications**:

**Example 1: Fair Billing Policy (Slack)**
- **Standard practice**: Charge for contracted seats whether used or not
- **Customer value approach**: Only charge for seats actually being used
- **Result**: "Fair billing" became differentiator, built trust, drove growth
- **Learning**: "Short-term revenue sacrifice for long-term customer relationship"

**Example 2: COVID-19 Response (Slack)**
- **Situation**: Businesses struggling to pay bills during pandemic
- **Standard practice**: Enforce contracts, collect payment
- **Customer value approach**: Give free credits to struggling businesses
- **Result**: Massive goodwill, customers remembered this when recovered

**Example 3: SLA Credits (Slack)**
- **Original policy**: "For any downtime, you get 100 times your money back"
- **Philosophy**: If we're down 2 minutes, pennies don't matter. If down 10 hours, we have bigger problems than refunds
- **Result**: Generous automatic credits built trust
- **Lesson learned**: Eventually hit $8M credit on major outage (too generous at scale)
- **Adaptation**: Changed terms after going public (business maturity required balance)

**Key Quote**: "We will automatically, proactively, preemptively without any input from you apply this credit to your account... we will do it on the aggregate for downtime, even if the issue didn't affect you as a customer."

### Step 4: Build Generosity into Company DNA
**Create systematic generosity as competitive advantage**

- **The Game Theory Logic**:
  - Acts of generosity signal "I will cooperate in this repeated game"
  - If you cooperate, customers will cooperate back
  - Everyone benefits from mutual cooperation
  - If you might defect (screw customers), customers will defect first

**Key Quote**: "The acts of generosity to me are, 'Oh, I am demonstrating that I am going to cooperate as we iterate in this game.' And if you do that, then people will also cooperate and you both benefit."

- **Areas for Systematic Generosity**:

  1. **Employee Benefits**:
     - 100% paid health insurance
     - Generous severance when laying people off
     - Active job placement help for departing employees
     - Extended benefits during transitions
     - Example: Crying real tears when laying people off, not viewing it as just business

  2. **Customer Policies**:
     - Automatic refunds/credits without requiring requests
     - Fair billing (only charge for usage)
     - No lock-in contracts (let customers leave easily)
     - Generous SLAs
     - Free features during crisis times

  3. **Shareholder Alignment**:
     - Direct listing (no lockup for employees)
     - Employee-friendly acquisition terms
     - Transparent communication

- **Benefits of Systematic Generosity**:
  - Attracts better employees who value ethics
  - Creates better workplace (fewer internal conflicts)
  - Builds customer trust and loyalty
  - Generates organic advocacy and word-of-mouth
  - Creates memorable moments that people talk about

### Step 5: Identify and Reject Short-Term Optimization
**Recognize behaviors that destroy long-term customer value**

- **Red Flags** (Things that feel "a little bit shady"):
  - Maximizing at the wrong moment
  - Taking advantage of customers
  - Misleading pricing or billing
  - Dark patterns in UX
  - Hiding cancellation options
  - Charging for things that should be free
  - Over-promising and under-delivering

- **The Litmus Test**:
  "If anything you're doing feels like a little bit shady, a little bit cheating, a little bit maximizing at the wrong moment or taking advantage of a customer or anything like that, definitely shouldn't do it."

- **Why This Matters**:
  - Not just ethics (though that matters)
  - Practical business advantage
  - "There's advantages for you. You're able to attract a better class of employees."
  - "If all your employees are ethical, then it's going to be a better place for everyone to work"
  - Fewer internal problems, happier employees, better retention

### Step 6: Extend Principle Beyond Customers
**Apply value-creation mindset to all stakeholders**

- **Employee Value**:
  - Personal example: Walking employee to ATM to withdraw $500 before Christmas
  - Minimizing things employees have to think about (100% health insurance)
  - Taking responsibility for employee wellbeing personally
  - Creating best possible circumstances for team

**Key Quote**: "Stewart is a leader who takes the responsibility he feels for his employees personally, and to which he extends the most generous circumstances he could muster."

- **Partner/Vendor Value**:
  - Fair negotiations
  - Long-term relationships over short-term wins
  - Transparency in dealings

- **Investor Value**:
  - Honest communication about challenges
  - Long-term value creation over short-term metrics
  - Alignment of incentives

### Step 7: Maintain Principle Through Growth
**Keep customer value focus as company scales**

- **Scaling Challenges**:
  - More layers between leadership and customers
  - Pressure for quarterly metrics
  - Professional managers who optimize for other things
  - Going public adds shareholder pressure

- **Maintenance Tactics**:
  - Continue all-hands mantra/chant at scale
  - Share customer stories regularly
  - Make customer value a hiring/performance criterion
  - Empower anyone to say "this destroys customer value" as veto
  - Celebrate examples of choosing customer value over revenue
  - Include customer value in OKRs and performance reviews

- **When to Make Exceptions**:
  - Company survival at stake (rare)
  - Regulatory requirements (must comply)
  - Scaling realities (e.g., too-generous SLA at massive scale)
  - Key principle: Make exceptions explicit and temporary, not silent and permanent

## Expected Outcomes
- **Cultural Alignment**: Everyone in company knows what "success" means
- **Decision Clarity**: Faster decisions when priorities are clear
- **Customer Loyalty**: Customers become advocates, not just users
- **Employee Satisfaction**: People feel good about work that genuinely helps others
- **Sustainable Growth**: Long-term value compounds through word-of-mouth and retention
- **Competitive Advantage**: Generosity and value-creation differentiate from competitors

## Common Pitfalls

### Pitfall 1: Treating as Marketing Slogan, Not Operating Principle
- **Problem**: Saying "customer first" but optimizing for revenue in practice
- **Result**: Cynicism from employees, customers see through it
- **Avoidance**: Make actual decisions based on principle, especially when costly

### Pitfall 2: Confusing Customer Value with Customer Requests
- **Problem**: Doing everything customers ask for
- **Result**: Bloated product, loss of vision
- **Avoidance**: Customer value = solving real problems well, not implementing all feature requests

### Pitfall 3: Ignoring Business Viability
- **Problem**: Being so generous company becomes unprofitable
- **Result**: Company fails, creating zero value for anyone
- **Example**: Slack's $8M SLA credit moment required adjustment
- **Avoidance**: Customer value enables business success, not replaces it

### Pitfall 4: Not Making it Concrete
- **Problem**: Abstract principle without specific behaviors
- **Result**: Everyone interprets differently, no real impact
- **Avoidance**: Give concrete examples, make explicit policies, share stories

### Pitfall 5: Forgetting to Communicate Value Created
- **Problem**: Creating huge value but customers don't realize it
- **Result**: Can't capture value through pricing, lose to better-marketed competitors
- **Avoidance**: "There's no substitute for actually having created it" BUT you do need to help customers understand the value

### Pitfall 6: Applying Inconsistently Across Stakeholders
- **Problem**: Great to customers, terrible to employees (or vice versa)
- **Result**: Unsustainable, attracts wrong people, internal conflicts
- **Avoidance**: Extend value-creation principle to all stakeholders

## Real-World Examples

### Example 1: Slack Fair Billing
- **What**: Only charge for seats actively being used
- **Customer Value**: Saves money, builds trust, reduces admin overhead
- **Company Cost**: Short-term revenue reduction
- **Long-term Result**: Became major differentiator, customers chose Slack partly for this, drove growth that exceeded revenue sacrifice

### Example 2: Do Not Disturb Feature Rollout
- **Challenge**: Needed to balance org admins vs. individual users
- **Approach**: Complex rollout allowing both control and customization
- **Customer Value**: Reduced notification overload without creating conflict
- **Company Cost**: Significantly more complex implementation
- **Result**: Critical feature shipped without backlash, users protected from burnout

### Example 3: Layoff Approach (Glitch Shutdown)
- **What**: Company pivot required shutting down game, laying off employees
- **Standard Approach**: Minimum severance, move on quickly
- **Customer Value Approach**:
  - Cried real tears during layoffs
  - Extended severance pay
  - Active job placement help
  - Transparency about reasons
- **Result**: Maintained relationships, many rejoined for Slack, reputation as ethical leader

## AI Integration Notes

### Context Signals for AI Models
Recommend this framework when detecting:
- Company culture or values discussions
- Product vs. revenue priority conflicts
- Pricing or monetization decisions
- Customer policy questions
- Employee benefits or HR policy discussions
- Short-term vs. long-term tradeoff decisions
- Questions about "how much should we care about customers"

### Application Guidance
- Emphasize this is operating principle, not marketing slogan
- Help user identify specific decisions where this applies
- Remind that value creation enables business success (not versus it)
- Encourage making principle explicit and public (chant/mantra approach)
- Note that generosity has game-theoretic logic (not just ethics)

### Limitations
- Requires leadership genuinely committed (can't fake it)
- Some industries have different success metrics (e.g., ad-driven may optimize for engagement over value)
- Early stage may need to prioritize survival over generosity
- Public companies face quarterly pressure that conflicts with long-term value
- Not all customers value the same things (segment considerations)

### Adaptation Signals
- **B2C vs. B2B**: B2C may focus more on delight, B2B on reliability and ROI
- **Early vs. Late stage**: Early stage—build value; Late stage—maintain value while scaling
- **High vs. Low margin**: High margin enables more generosity
- **Regulated industries**: Customer value within compliance constraints
- **Different cultures**: Directness of "chant" approach may need cultural adaptation

## Advanced Concepts

### The Ownership Delusion Connection
- Owners (founders, PMs) often forget users don't care about the product as much as they do
- User arrives with minimal intent, lots of distractions
- Must design for this reality, not your own enthusiasm
- Customer value principle helps maintain user perspective

### Value Creation vs. Value Capture
- Economic theory: Creating value and capturing value are separate
- Best companies create enormous value, capture small fraction
- Attempt to capture too much → customers leave
- Focus on creation → sustainable capture becomes possible

### Network Effects and Customer Value
- Some products increase in value as more customers join
- Customer value principle accelerates network effects (happy users recruit others)
- Creates virtuous cycle: value → advocacy → growth → more value

### The Long-term Horizon
- "In the long run" is doing heavy lifting in the mantra
- Explicitly acknowledges short-term sacrifices may be necessary
- Sets expectation that value creation compounds over time
- Protects against quarterly optimization pressure
