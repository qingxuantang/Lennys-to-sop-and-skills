## Metadata
- **Source**: Uri Levine (Waze Co-founder) - Lenny's Podcast
- **Domain**: Strategy / Product Management
- **Type**: Framework + Process
- **Applicable To**: Founders, Product Leaders at pre-PMF and early PMF stages
- **Difficulty**: Intermediate

## Overview
Product-market fit is a multi-year journey of iteration and failure that founders must navigate. This framework explains what PMF actually means, how to measure it, how long it takes, and how to iterate systematically until you achieve it. Based on Uri Levine's experience taking 4 years to find PMF with Waze and similar journeys across 10+ companies.

## When to Use
- Pre-product launch (understanding what journey lies ahead)
- Early product with unclear traction
- Struggling with retention/engagement
- Considering pivot decisions
- Explaining timeline expectations to investors/team
- Expanding to new markets or segments

## Prerequisites
- Problem validation completed (see: Fall in Love with Problem framework)
- Initial product or prototype exists
- Access to user feedback mechanisms
- Ability to measure retention metrics
- Development team to implement iterations

## Understanding Product-Market Fit

### Definition
**Product-Market Fit = You create value to your customers**

That's it. Simple but profound.

### The Core Metric
**PMF has ONE metric: RETENTION**

**The Logic:**
- If you create value → they will come back
- If they're not coming back → you're not creating value

**Podcast Example:**
"Most of your listeners are returning because you create value for them. That's it."

### The PMF Guarantee
**If you do NOT figure out product-market fit, you will DIE.**

You never heard of companies that didn't figure out PMF. Why? They simply died.

### The Product Freeze
**Once you achieve PMF, the product doesn't change anymore.**

**Test**: Think about applications you use daily:
- Google Search today = Google Search when you first used it
- Waze today = Waze when you first used it
- WhatsApp today = WhatsApp when you first used it
- Netflix today = Netflix when you first used it

**Why?** Because this is the value they created. They don't want to change that.

**What we DON'T know:** How long did it take them to GET to that point?

## The Timeline Reality

### How Long Does PMF Take?

**Real Examples:**
- **Waze**: 4 years
- **Microsoft**: 5 years
- **Netflix**: 10 years
- **ChatGPT**: 6 years (founded 2016, launched to public 2022)

**Critical Insight:** You only heard about them AFTER they figured out PMF. Before that, they didn't exist to you. After that, they don't change the core product.

### The Longest Phase
PMF is THE LONGEST part of building a company.

**The difference between corporate and startup:**
- **Corporate knows**: Value prop, product, pricing, target audience, go-to-market, just need to execute
- **Startup doesn't know**: Any of those things - must figure out everything

## The Journey of Failures

### The Iteration Pattern
"We try one thing and it doesn't work. We try another thing and it doesn't work. We keep trying different things until we find one thing that DOES work."

**Two Immediate Conclusions:**

#### Conclusion 1: If You're Afraid to Fail, You Already Failed
- If afraid to fail → won't try
- If don't try → can't succeed
- "If you haven't failed, that's because you haven't tried new things before" - Albert Einstein
- "I've failed over and over and over again, and this is what made me successful" - Michael Jordan

#### Conclusion 2: Fail Fast
**The Math of Failing Fast:**
- Fail fast → plenty of time for more attempts
- More attempts → more likely to find what works
- Like basketball from half court: 1 shot likely miss, many shots one will land

**The Enemy of Good Enough:**
"The biggest enemy of good enough is perfect."
- Don't need perfect
- Need good enough to win the market
- Start with NOT good enough
- Iterate until you BECOME good enough
- Then you win

## The Waze PMF Journey (Detailed Case Study)

### Phase 1: Success in Israel (Home Market)
**Context:** Small market, controlled environment
**Result:** Very successful
**Learning:** Thought we understood the formula

### Phase 2: Global Launch (End of 2009)
**Assumption:** Crowdsourcing works anywhere, just start from blank page
**Reality:** NOT good enough anywhere that mattered

**Where it DIDN'T work:**
- United States
- Western Europe
- Latin America
- Asia
- Basically everywhere important

**Where it DID work (4 places):**
- Czech Republic
- Slovakia
- Latvia
- Ecuador

### Phase 3: The Iteration Cycle (2009-2011)

**Iteration 1:**
1. Spoke with drivers
2. Asked what didn't work
3. They told us (they wanted it to succeed)
4. Built next version addressing everything
5. "We KNOW this is it"
6. It's NOT

**Iteration 2:**
1. Spoke with drivers again
2. Asked what didn't work
3. They told us again
4. Built next version
5. "Now we have CONVICTION this will work"
6. It's STILL NOT

**Continue:** Iteration after iteration after iteration after iteration

**Duration:** MORE than a year of iterations

**Breakthrough:** Beginning of 2011 - started seeing it work

### Phase 4: Market-by-Market Success

**United States:**
- Los Angeles first
- Then San Francisco
- Then Washington D.C.
- Then Chicago
- Then New York
- Then Atlanta
- One metro after another

**Europe:**
- Italy first
- Then France
- Then Netherlands
- Then Sweden
- Then Spain
- One country after another

**Latin America:**
- Colombia first
- Then Chile
- Then Brazil
- Then Mexico
- Rest of Latin America followed

**Asia:**
- Multiple countries
- NOT all of them (Japan never worked)

### The Japan Lesson: When Crowdsourcing Fails

**House Numbering Systems:**

**US System:**
- Every block = 100 numbers
- With map, can approximate location without exact house numbers

**Most Western World:**
- Geographical/sequential order
- Odd on one side, even on other
- Few house numbers can locate precisely

**UK System:**
- Starts on one side
- Continues on other side
- Still has order

**Japan System:**
- Chronological order
- Oldest house = #1
- Second oldest = #2 (could be miles away)
- **Need PERFECT information**

**Crowdsourcing Limitation:** If you need perfect information, crowdsourcing may not be the right approach.

## Measuring Product-Market Fit

### The Retention Framework

**For High-Frequency Products:**
- Look at 3-month retention
- 30-40-50% is good indication
- Track when users convert (usually 3rd or 4th use)

**Example - Waze:**
- Compared everything to Israel (the working market)
- Looked at frequency of use
- Measured: How long until next try? And next try?
- If NOT reaching 4th use → "We gave it a try, we like the story, but not good enough"

**The Frequency Dependency:**
- Traffic app used daily → 3-month retention works
- Tax filing used yearly → Very different retention pattern
- Must adapt metric to product frequency

### Comparing to Benchmark Markets

**Waze Strategy:**
1. Had working market (Israel) as benchmark
2. Launched new markets
3. Compared new market metrics to Israel
4. If metrics matched → PMF achieved
5. If metrics lagged → Keep iterating

**What to Compare:**
- Frequency of use
- Time between uses
- Retention curves
- Engagement depth
- User return patterns

## The Four Phases of Startup Journey

### Phase 1: All Over the Place
**Focus:** Figure out product-market fit
**What you need:** Product developers, product lead
**What you DON'T need:** Sales, business development, even marketing

**Why?**
- No product to sell
- Can't market something that doesn't create value
- Must iterate until you CREATE value

**Critical:** This is the ONLY thing that matters. If you don't achieve PMF, you die.

### Phase 2: Post-PMF - Business Model OR Growth
**Decision Point:** High frequency or low frequency?

**Path A - High Frequency:**
- Focus on GROWTH first
- Word-of-mouth will drive it
- Example: Waze used daily → tell someone daily → natural growth
- Business model can come later

**Path B - Low Frequency:**
- Focus on BUSINESS MODEL first
- Sentenced to acquire users for life
- Example: Tax returns once/year → can't rely on word-of-mouth
- Need to know how to monetize before scaling acquisition

**The Shift:**
- Product development no longer focused on value creation
- Now focused on business model or scale
- **Entire company must shift gears**
- This is HARD - "finding the clutch"

### Phase 3: The Other One (Growth or Business Model)
After Phase 2, tackle whichever you didn't do yet

### Phase 4: Scaling and Optimization

**Key Insight:** "Focus is not about what we ARE doing, it's about what we are NOT doing. These are the hard decisions."

## Iteration Best Practices

### 1. Talk to Users Who FAILED
**Common Mistake:** Speaking with successful users at bottom of funnel

**Better Approach:** Speak with those who FAILED
- Downloaded but didn't register
- Registered but didn't use
- Used but didn't return

**Why:** They know something you need to know - the WHY

### 2. Watch Users (Don't Just Ask)
**The Waze Camera Discovery:**

**Uri's Assumption:**
- Users would click on screen to take selfie with iPhone

**Steve Wozniak's Use:**
- Used volume button on side to take photo

**Woz's Response:** "Finally! Someone using it the way I meant it to be."

**The Waze Audio/Visual Discovery:**

**Test:** How do you use Waze?
- ~70% watch screen for navigation
- ~20-30% listen to audio prompts

**Critical Insight:**
- No right or wrong
- Different people use it differently
- Until this test, users didn't know others used it differently
- Users don't care that others use it differently
- **But if you're building and don't know this, you're building wrong product**

### 3. Simplicity is Ultimate Sophistication
**Leonardo da Vinci:** "Simplicity is the ultimate sophistication"

**The Feature Trap:**
- Iteration 1: Add features
- Iteration 2: Add features
- Iteration 3: Add features
- Eventually: Add features people actually use

**What to do NEXT:** Remove all features people are NOT using
**Why:** They add complexity without value

**The Early Majority Problem:**
- Early majority = 1/3 of population = market leaders
- They're AFRAID of change
- They think: "Don't rock the boat"
- They fear: "It will be too complex, I won't get it, I'll feel like an idiot"
- **Solution:** Simplicity

**Product Owner Challenge:**
- Most PMs are innovators or early adopters
- Cannot understand early majority unless you WATCH them
- They are not wrong - this is how they behave

### 4. Understand Different User Segments

**Technology Adoption Curve:**

1. **Innovators (2%)**: Use it because it's new
2. **Early Adopters (13-15%)**: Use if there's value, quit if not
3. **Early Majority (~33%)**: AFRAID of change, need simplicity - **WIN THEM = WIN MARKET**
4. **Late Majority (~33%)**: Only use if they HAVE to
5. **Laggards (~16%)**: Last to adopt, extreme resistance

**Critical for PMF:**
- Can achieve initial traction with innovators/early adopters
- TRUE PMF = winning early majority
- Early majority needs: simplicity, references, hand-holding

## Expected Outcomes

When you successfully navigate PMF iteration:

1. **Retention Curve Stabilizes**: Users keep coming back
2. **Product Stops Changing**: Core value prop is set
3. **Word-of-Mouth Begins**: (if high frequency)
4. **Market Expansion Works**: Can replicate in new markets
5. **Team Can Shift Gears**: Focus moves from product to growth/business model
6. **Fundability Increases**: Investors see the traction

## Common Pitfalls

### Pitfall 1: Giving Up Too Early
**Problem:** PMF takes 2-10 years, most founders give up before that
**Solution:** Understand this is normal timeline, not failure

### Pitfall 2: Adding Features Instead of Removing
**Problem:** Complexity kills adoption by early majority
**Solution:** Remove unused features to create simplicity

### Pitfall 3: Only Talking to Successful Users
**Problem:** They can't tell you what's broken
**Solution:** Talk to people who churned or failed to activate

### Pitfall 4: Not Watching Users
**Problem:** Assumptions about usage don't match reality
**Solution:** Observe actual behavior, don't rely on assumptions

### Pitfall 5: Changing Product After PMF
**Problem:** You've found the value, changing it loses that
**Solution:** Freeze core product, iterate on scale/monetization instead

### Pitfall 6: Skipping Phases
**Problem:** Trying to do growth AND business model AND PMF simultaneously
**Solution:** Focus on ONE phase at a time - "the main thing is to keep the main thing the main thing"

### Pitfall 7: Wrong Retention Metric
**Problem:** Using 3-month retention for yearly-use product
**Solution:** Adapt metric to product's natural usage frequency

### Pitfall 8: Assuming Your Market = Other Markets
**Problem:** What works in one geography/segment may not transfer
**Solution:** Validate in each new market, iterate as needed

## Comparing to Israel: The Benchmark Strategy

**When launching Waze globally:**
1. Had working market (Israel) with known metrics
2. Could compare: "Is LA behaving like Tel Aviv?"
3. If yes → we're on track
4. If no → keep iterating

**Benefit:** Clear success criteria rather than guessing

**Application:** If you find PMF in any segment, use it as benchmark for expansions

## The Certainty Discovery

**Original Waze Vision:** Help people avoid traffic jams

**Reality Today:** More traffic jams than 2007
- Obviously Uri is "not done"
- But also... that's not the real value

**Actual Value:** Creating CERTAINTY
- Know exactly when you'll arrive
- Way higher value than saving time
- **Discovered by talking to US users**

**User Feedback:**
"If I'm driving Cupertino to San Francisco, I can take 101 or 280. I don't want to change routes unless something dramatic. But I DO want to know how long it will take. I'll stay on 101, just tell me the time."

**Learning:** Your perception of value ≠ user's perception of value. Listen to THEM.

## AI Integration Notes

**Trigger Signals for This SOP:**
- User mentions: finding PMF, product-market fit, retention issues, user churn
- Early-stage product questions
- Iteration strategy questions
- "How long should this take?"
- Pivot considerations
- Market expansion challenges
- User feedback analysis

**Adaptation Guidance:**
- **For pre-product founders**: Focus on timeline expectations and failure mindset
- **For early traction**: Focus on retention metrics and iteration process
- **For multi-market expansion**: Focus on benchmark comparison approach
- **For struggling products**: Focus on watching users who failed

**Key Questions to Ask:**
- "What's your retention curve look like?"
- "How often do users naturally use this?"
- "What did your churned users say?"
- "Have you watched users actually using it?"
- "What features are people NOT using?"
- "Who are you building for - innovators or early majority?"

**Contextual Adaptations:**
- B2B products: PMF timeline often longer, different retention patterns
- Consumer products: Can be faster but need high frequency for word-of-mouth
- Platform/marketplace: Two-sided PMF makes this even more complex
- Deep tech: May have longer timeline due to technical complexity

**Limitations:**
- Not all products fit high-frequency model
- Some innovations (like iPhone) create new behaviors vs. solve problems
- Retention metric alone doesn't capture full picture in some cases
- Timeline estimates are broad - actual experience varies widely
