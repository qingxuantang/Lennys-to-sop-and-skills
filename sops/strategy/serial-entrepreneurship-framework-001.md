## Metadata
- **Source**: Uri Levine (Waze Co-founder) - Lenny's Podcast
- **Domain**: Strategy / Entrepreneurship / Career Development
- **Type**: Framework + Philosophy
- **Applicable To**: Entrepreneurs, Repeat Founders, Those considering multiple ventures
- **Difficulty**: Advanced

## Overview
A comprehensive framework for approaching entrepreneurship as a repeatable practice across multiple companies, based on Uri Levine's experience co-founding 10+ companies, being on 20 boards, advising 50+ startups, and building two unicorns. This framework covers mindset, decision-making, pattern recognition, and lessons that compound across ventures.

## When to Use
- Considering starting another company after exit or failure
- Evaluating multiple startup opportunities simultaneously
- Building portfolio approach to entrepreneurship
- Deciding whether to pivot or start fresh
- Teaching/mentoring other entrepreneurs
- Reflecting on lessons from current venture for next one

## Prerequisites
- At least one startup experience (success or failure)
- Willingness to accept failure as learning
- Long-term commitment to entrepreneurship
- Financial runway to sustain serial attempts

## The Serial Entrepreneur Mindset

### Core Philosophy: Value Creation as Destiny

**Uri's Mission Statement:**
"My destiny is about value creation. I feel equally rewarded when I build something myself or guide someone to build it."

**Two Modes of Value Creation:**
1. **Direct**: Building your own companies
2. **Indirect**: Teaching, advising, mentoring (through boards, advising, writing)

**Book as Amplification:**
"I wrote the book to make a bigger impact. The book fulfills my destiny as a teacher, sharing my know-how with entrepreneurs to help them become more successful."

### Reserve the Right to Fail Again

**Critical Quote:**
"I reserve the right for my biggest failure yet to come."

**What This Means:**
- Don't become complacent after success
- Keep trying new things
- Failure is ongoing possibility, not past event
- Each venture is new risk

**Supporting Quote:**
"I keep trying new things. I keep doing things. Eventually I will fail as much as... maybe I'm more successful statistically than others, but I will fail."

### The "Today is Day One" Philosophy

**Application Across Life:**
"Today is the first day of the rest of your life. Ask yourself: Knowing what I know today, would I do something different? If the answer is yes, then do something different TODAY."

**Applications:**
- Hiring decisions (30-day review)
- Company direction
- Personal relationships
- Career choices
- Any major commitment

**Example - Career Advice to His 5 Children (20s-30s):**
1. If you don't like your job, ask why
2. Figure out what you can change
3. Try to change it for 90 days
4. If still the case, quit
5. **Set a timeline or it'll never happen**

## Pattern Recognition Across Ventures

### Starting with Problems (The Consistent Pattern)

**All of Uri's Startups Start the Same Way:**
1. Personal frustration with a problem
2. Think: "There must be a different way"
3. Validate it's a big problem (speak with others)
4. Build solution only after validation

**Examples:**
- "I hate traffic jams" → Waze
- "I hate leaving money on the table" → Oversee/FairFly (airfare price drops)
- "Tax returns are complex/expensive" → Fibo
- "401k plans are neglected" → Pontera
- "Restaurant reservations are inefficient" → Order.chat

**The Consistency:**
Even 10+ companies in, the pattern doesn't change. Why? Because it works.

### Lessons That Compound

#### Lesson 1: Regulatory Risk Awareness

**From Fibo Failure:**
- Built successful tax filing product
- Increased tax filings by 25% in one year
- Tax authority shut them down overnight
- Not enough runway to fight regulator

**Applied to Future Ventures:**
"I don't want to rely on a regulator to allow me or not allow me to do what I want to do."

**Waze Learning:**
Early business model was selling data to municipalities and governments. Realized:
- Very slow sales cycles
- Governments don't care (even when offered free)
- Changed to advertising model
- "I don't like to work with regulators, that is all"

**Principle:** Avoid business models dependent on regulatory approval or government customers

#### Lesson 2: The 30-Day Firing Rule

**Pattern Observed Across Failures:**
- Spoke with entrepreneurs whose startups failed
- ~50% said: "Team was not right"
- Asked: "When did you know?"
- Answer: "Within the first month" (ALL of them)

**The Realization:**
"Wait a minute. If you knew within first month that team was not right and you didn't do anything, the problem was NOT that the team was not right. The problem was that the CEO did not make hard decisions."

**The System (Applied to All Ventures):**
Every time you hire someone:
1. Mark calendar for 30 days from hire
2. Ask: "Knowing what I know today, would I hire this person?"
3. If YES → Tell them, give more equity, buy loyalty for life
4. If NO → Fire immediately

**Why It Works:**
- Top performers leave when CEO doesn't make hard decisions
- Small organization = everyone knows who shouldn't be there
- Nature of the beast: If CEO doesn't act, best people leave

#### Lesson 3: Crisis is Inevitable

**After 10+ Companies:**
"Building a startup is a journey from one crisis to the next."

**What Changed:**
- First company: Crisis feels like failure
- Fifth company: Crisis feels normal
- Tenth company: Can categorize crisis types and have response playbooks

**Crisis Typology Developed:**
1. Cash crisis (revenue loss, funding disappears)
2. Product-market fit crisis (regulation, competition, market shift)

**Applied Wisdom:**
- Don't try to avoid crisis (impossible)
- Best preparation = plenty of cash (18-month runway)
- Make decisions fast
- Communicate with transparency
- Never give up (unless mission invalid or team irreparably broken)

#### Lesson 4: Investor Selection Matters

**Pattern Recognition:**
- Strategic investors in travel space (WeSki)
- When COVID hit, they had own problems
- Couldn't help portfolio company
- Had to do pay-to-play to survive

**Toxic Investors Experience:**
"If you brought toxic investors into the board and they started to control the company... they create more damage than help. And you're unable to change that anymore, then this is a good reason to give up."

**Applied Principle:**
- Vet investors for more than just money
- Understand their portfolio pressures
- Avoid those who will become toxic in crisis
- One of only two valid reasons to give up

### The Portfolio Approach

**Current Active Companies:**
10 different startups in multiple areas:
1. Pontera - helping Americans retire richer (401k optimization)
2. WeSki - booking.com of ski vacations
3. Oversee/FairFly - airfare price monitoring
4. Medical AI - clinical decision support
5. Six others mentioned but not detailed

**Plus:**
- On boards of 20 companies (12 currently active)
- Advising 50+ startups

**Strategy:**
- Multiple bets across different domains
- Different stages of maturity
- Different problem spaces
- Some will fail, some will succeed
- Portfolio approach increases odds

### Problems Still Worth Solving (Uri's Current List)

**Mobility:**
"Every year instead of getting better, it's getting worse. So mobility is still a problem."

**Medical Services:**
"US medical services are 5-10x more expensive than Germany. Not better, simply more expensive. Where is the inefficiency?"

**Education:**
"Anything we're still doing the same way our parents did is probably something we need to revisit."

**The Lens:**
Look for places where inefficiency or outdated methods persist.

## Decision Framework for Next Venture

### Question 1: Is This What I Would Do Starting Today?

**Context:** Used when considering pivot vs. new company

**Application:**
- Existing company lost product-market fit
- Considering pivot to new direction
- Ask: "If I were starting from scratch TODAY, is this what I'd do?"
- If YES → Pivot current company
- If NO → Shut down and start fresh

**Why It Works:**
- Removes sunk cost bias
- Forces honesty about opportunity
- Clarifies if continuing makes sense

### Question 2: Do I Have Unique Assets?

**Assets to Evaluate:**
1. **Technology**: Already developed tech applicable to new problem
2. **Team**: People skilled and motivated for new direction
3. **Know-how**: Domain knowledge that provides advantage
4. **Energy**: Personal passion and capacity to go again

**Minimum Bar:**
Need at least ONE significant advantage. If starting from zero on all dimensions, better to start fresh company.

### Question 3: Can I Validate the New Problem?

**Process:**
1. Speak with potential users
2. Get their description of the problem
3. Look for emotional engagement
4. Validate it's worth solving

**Don't Skip This:**
Even with 10+ companies experience, still validate every new problem.

### Question 4: Will the Team Come?

**Validation Process:**
Tell team honestly:
"Guess what? We're fucked. Our underlying assumptions are no longer valid. This is our new opportunity. We can go this path or we can die."

**Possible Outcomes:**
1. Team validates → Good signal
2. Team proposes better path → Even better (they're closer to problem)
3. Team doesn't believe → Wrong direction

**Why This Matters:**
Underlying assumption is team continues. If they won't, the whole plan fails.

### Question 5: Will Investors Support?

**Two Options to Offer:**
1. We give you your money back
2. This is what we're going to try

**Investor Psychology:**
- They don't want money back
- They want returns
- Usually support pivot if assets exist

**Alternative Nuclear Option:**
Shut down current company, start new company with same team. Bigger threat to investors, so they usually support pivot.

## The Teaching and Doing Balance

### The Dual Path

**Building Companies (Doing):**
- 10+ co-founded companies
- 4 still operating
- 2 unicorns
- Multiple exits

**Guiding Companies (Teaching):**
- 20 company boards (12 active)
- 50+ companies advised
- Book: "Fall in Love with the Problem, Not the Solution"
- Podcast appearances
- Email responses ("I do answer all my emails")

**The Equal Reward:**
"I feel equally rewarded when I build something myself or I guide someone to build it."

### Why Write a Book?

**Original Goal:**
"I want you to read the book. I don't want you to buy the book. I want you to READ the book."

**The ROI Frame:**
"The book is going to be the best return on investment you ever made. Not the $20-30 it costs, but the TIME you spend reading it."

**Purpose Over Profit:**
"I have a purpose in life and this is creating value. I believe this book is going to be valuable for you. If I can be valuable for you, then I serve my purpose."

**Steve Wozniak's Forward:**
Called it "the Bible for entrepreneurs" and said "I wish I had that when I started."

### The Answering Emails Practice

**The Commitment:**
"I do answer all of my emails."

**Example Story:**
- Mark Randolph (Netflix founder) also answers all emails
- Uri reached out about book endorsement
- Message: "We have 3 things in common: 1) I answer emails too, 2) I use your product you use mine, 3) I heard 'that will never work' more than you did"
- Resulted in endorsement

**Why It Matters:**
- Extends teaching beyond direct interactions
- Helps more entrepreneurs
- Creates network effects
- Lives the mission

## Common Patterns Across Multiple Ventures

### The Timeline Pattern
**Consistent Reality:**
- Product-market fit: 2-10 years
- Waze: 4 years
- Pontera: 12 years with 2 pivots
- Most others: 3-7 years

**Application:**
Don't compare to exception cases. Expect years, not months.

### The Pivot Pattern
**When It's Happened:**
- Waze: Changed business model (gov data sales → advertising)
- Pontera: Pivoted twice (Israel → US, then regulation change)
- Oversee: B2C → B2B

**Success Rate:**
Most pivots work if assets exist and problem is validated

### The Word-of-Mouth Pattern
**Observation:**
"If I ask 100 people how did you hear about Waze, 95-99 will tell me 'someone told me.'"

**Requirement:**
Only works with high frequency of use
- Waze daily use → daily opportunity to tell someone
- Tax returns yearly → yearly opportunity

**Application:**
Know upfront if your product supports word-of-mouth growth

## Expected Outcomes

When applying serial entrepreneurship framework:

1. **Higher Success Rate**: Compound learning across ventures
2. **Faster Pattern Recognition**: Identify problems/solutions quicker
3. **Better Risk Management**: Know which risks to take/avoid
4. **Stronger Network**: Board seats and advising create deal flow
5. **More Impact**: Direct building + teaching/advising
6. **Portfolio Returns**: Not dependent on single company success
7. **Sustainable Career**: Can continue building indefinitely

## Common Pitfalls

### Pitfall 1: Assuming Success Transfers
**Problem**: "I built a unicorn, so next one will be easy"
**Reality**: Each venture is new journey with own challenges
**Solution**: Reserve the right for biggest failure yet to come

### Pitfall 2: Not Learning from Failures
**Problem**: Repeating same mistakes across ventures
**Solution**: Extract lessons systematically (like Fibo → no regulatory risk)

### Pitfall 3: Too Many Simultaneous Ventures
**Problem**: Spreading too thin, none get proper attention
**Reality**: Uri has 10, but many are later stage with CEOs
**Solution**: Know your capacity, prioritize focused attention

### Pitfall 4: Losing Passion for Problems
**Problem**: Just seeing business opportunities without personal connection
**Solution**: Must FALL IN LOVE with each problem, not just see market

### Pitfall 5: Not Leveraging Network
**Problem**: Starting from scratch on every venture
**Solution**: Use board seats, advising, and prior connections

### Pitfall 6: Ignoring Sunk Costs
**Problem**: Continuing bad path because already invested
**Solution**: "If starting today, would I do this?" test

### Pitfall 7: Teaching Without Doing
**Problem**: Becoming armchair entrepreneur
**Solution**: Stay in the arena, keep building

### Pitfall 8: Doing Without Reflecting
**Problem**: Missing the lessons from each venture
**Solution**: Extract and codify learnings (like writing a book)

## The Meta-Learning System

### After Each Venture (Success or Failure)

**Questions to Ask:**
1. What did I learn about finding problems?
2. What did I learn about team building?
3. What did I learn about fundraising?
4. What did I learn about product-market fit?
5. What did I learn about crisis management?
6. What would I do differently?
7. What pattern emerged?

**Codification:**
- Write it down
- Share with others
- Apply to next venture
- Refine over time

### The Luck Philosophy

**Silverstein Quote** (Real estate developer):
"85% luck, 15% skill. If I could change one thing, I'd replace the 15% skill with another 15% luck."

**Uri's Definition of Luck:**
"Opportunity meets readiness."
- Readiness is up to you
- Opportunity is not always controllable
- Maximize readiness to capture opportunity

**Application:**
- Build skills across ventures (readiness)
- Stay in position for opportunities
- Recognize opportunity when it appears

## The 10-Year View

### Company Stages Across Portfolio

**New (0-2 years):**
- Still finding product-market fit
- High failure risk
- Maximum learning

**Growth (3-7 years):**
- Found PMF, scaling
- Moderate risk
- Fundraising and team building

**Mature (8+ years):**
- Established business model
- Lower risk (relatively)
- Optimization and exit considerations

**Ideal Portfolio:**
Mix across stages, so always learning from new while benefiting from mature.

### Time Allocation

**Direct Building:**
- 4 companies as active founder/co-founder
- These get primary time

**Governance:**
- 12 active boards
- Monthly/quarterly involvement
- Strategic guidance

**Advisory:**
- 50+ companies
- Lighter touch
- Specific problem-solving

**Teaching:**
- Book, podcasts, emails
- Amplifies impact
- Future network building

- Startup Crisis Management
- Product-Market Fit Iteration
- 30-Day Hiring Review Process
- Pivot vs Persevere Decision Framework

## AI Integration Notes

**Trigger Signals for This SOP:**
- Multiple startup experiences mentioned
- Considering "what's next" after exit/failure
- Portfolio or parallel ventures discussed
- Repeat founder patterns
- Looking for meta-lessons across experiences
- Teaching/mentoring aspirations

**Adaptation Guidance:**
- **First-time founders**: Use as roadmap for long-term career
- **Second venture**: Focus on applying lessons from first
- **Serial entrepreneurs**: Use for pattern validation and gap identification
- **Advisors/investors**: Understand founder perspective across multiple ventures

**Key Questions to Prompt:**
- "What did you learn from your last venture?"
- "If you were starting today, would you do this?"
- "Do you have unique assets for this direction?"
- "What patterns are you seeing across your companies?"
- "How are you balancing building and teaching?"

**Contextual Adaptations:**
- Some entrepreneurs are single-company focused (nothing wrong with that)
- Serial entrepreneurship requires financial runway
- Not everyone has capacity for portfolio approach
- Teaching mode may not appeal to all operators

**Limitations:**
- Uri's success rate is exceptional (survivorship bias)
- Portfolio approach requires significant time/energy
- Not all lessons transfer across different domains
- Market timing matters more in some cases than pattern recognition
- Some entrepreneurs burn out after one or two ventures
