# 7 Powers Strategic Assessment Framework

## Metadata
- **Source**: Hamilton Helmer - Lenny's Podcast
- **Domain**: Strategy
- **Type**: Framework SOP
- **Applicable To**: Founders, CEOs, Strategy Leaders, Product Leaders
- **Company Stage**: All stages (different powers relevant at different stages)
- **Difficulty**: Advanced

## Overview
The 7 Powers framework identifies the only seven sources of sustainable competitive advantage that create durable business value. This SOP guides you through assessing which powers are available to your business, which you currently have, and how to develop them based on your company stage.

## When to Use
- Evaluating your startup's strategic positioning
- Assessing competitive advantage before fundraising
- Determining product/market strategy
- Planning long-term business defensibility
- Evaluating acquisition targets
- Understanding why growth is or isn't sustainable

## Prerequisites
- Clear understanding of your business model
- Knowledge of competitive landscape
- Awareness of your company's current stage (origination, takeoff, stability)

## Procedure

### Step 1: Understand the 7 Powers
Each power requires both a **benefit** (cost or price advantage) AND a **barrier** (something competitors can't easily replicate):

1. **Scale Economies**: Lower unit costs due to larger scale (fixed costs spread over more units)
2. **Network Economies**: Value increases as more users join (must be material, not just "network effects")
3. **Counter-Positioning**: New business model incumbent can't adopt without damaging existing business
4. **Switching Costs**: Customers face costs to switch to competitor
5. **Branding**: Durable attribution of higher value to a product (only available in stability phase)
6. **Cornered Resource**: Exclusive access to valuable resource (patents, talent, etc.)
7. **Process Power**: Embedded organizational processes enabling lower costs (rare, requires opacity)

### Step 2: Filter by Company Stage

**Origination Phase (Pre-PMF)**:
- Focus on: Counter-Positioning
- Available later: Scale, Network, Switching Costs
- NOT available yet: Branding, Process Power

**Takeoff Phase (Rapid Growth)**:
- Focus on: Counter-Positioning, Scale Economies, Switching Costs, Network Economies
- Win the market share battle through operational excellence
- Powers establish during this phase

**Stability Phase (Mature)**:
- All powers potentially available
- Branding and Process Power only become possible here
- Focus shifts to defending existing power

### Step 3: Assess Counter-Positioning First
For early-stage companies, start here:

**Questions to ask:**
1. What existing alternatives are you replacing?
2. Why can't incumbents easily copy your approach?
3. Would copying damage their existing business?
4. Is this a technological shift that enables a new model?

**Example**: Netflix vs Blockbuster - Blockbuster couldn't adopt streaming without cannibalizing stores

### Step 4: Evaluate Scale Economies
**Ask:**
- Do you have significant fixed costs that can be spread?
- Does your cost per unit decrease materially as you grow?
- Is the advantage large enough to matter competitively?

**Caution**: Data-driven scale economies are often overstated. The curve flattens, and competitors may already have "enough" data.

### Step 5: Assess Network Economies (Not Just Effects)
**Critical distinction**: Network effects ≠ Network economies

**Test for true network economy:**
1. Does value materially increase with more users?
2. Is the advantage large enough to create pricing power?
3. Can you sustain meaningfully different margins long-term?

**Example**: Uber/Lyft have network effects but NOT network economies - the advantage isn't material enough

### Step 6: Evaluate Switching Costs
**Types:**
- Financial costs (migration, retraining)
- Data/content lock-in
- Integration complexity
- Learning curve

**Ask:**
- What would a customer lose by switching?
- How long does it take to switch?
- Is this cost material relative to your price?

### Step 7: Apply the "Castle or Shack" Test
For any claimed advantage, ask:
1. Is this a castle (truly valuable) or a shack (easily replaceable)?
2. Can a competitor hire consultants/talent to replicate this?
3. Could someone copy this in 6-12 months?

**Example**: Netflix UI was easily copied by Blockbuster. It's operationally excellent but NOT a power.

### Step 8: Avoid Common Misidentifications

**"We have the best team"** - Usually NOT power
- Operational excellence is mimicable
- You're on a treadmill - stop running and you get creamed
- Not the same as sustainable advantage

**"We have data/flywheel"** - Usually NOT power
- Data advantages flatten quickly
- Most companies claiming flywheel don't have material network economies

**"We're fastest/first"** - Usually NOT power
- Speed is operational excellence, not strategic power
- Can be replicated

### Step 9: Document Your Power Assessment

Create a simple matrix:

| Power | Do We Have It? | Evidence | Can We Develop It? | Stage Available |
|-------|---------------|----------|-------------------|-----------------|
| Counter-Positioning | ? | | | Origination |
| Scale Economies | ? | | | Takeoff |
| Network Economies | ? | | | Takeoff |
| Switching Costs | ? | | | Takeoff |
| Branding | ? | | | Stability |
| Cornered Resource | ? | | | Any |
| Process Power | ? | | | Stability |

## Expected Outcomes
- Clear understanding of current strategic position
- Identification of which powers to pursue
- Recognition of false/weak advantages
- Stage-appropriate strategic priorities
- Foundation for long-term value creation

## Common Pitfalls

### Confusing operational excellence with power
- Great execution ≠ sustainable advantage
- Everything you do daily maintains parity, not superiority

### Claiming powers you don't have
- Most startups overestimate their defensibility
- Apply the "too good to be true" test

### Focusing on unavailable powers
- Don't pursue branding as an early-stage startup
- Focus on what's achievable at your stage

### Ignoring the barrier requirement
- A benefit without a barrier isn't power
- Ask: "Why can't competitors do this?"

## AI Integration Notes

### Context signals that should trigger this SOP:
- User mentions "competitive advantage," "moat," "defensibility"
- Questions about strategic positioning
- Fundraising preparation discussions
- Discussions of "network effects" or "flywheel"

### How to adapt:
- For pre-PMF: Focus heavily on counter-positioning
- For growth-stage: Emphasize scale, network, switching
- For mature companies: Include branding and process power

### Limitations:
- Framework doesn't guarantee execution
- Industry economics must be deeply understood
- Assessment can take weeks for complex businesses
- Requires honest evaluation, not optimistic projection
