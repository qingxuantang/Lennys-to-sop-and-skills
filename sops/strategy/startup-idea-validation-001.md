- **Difficulty**: Beginner to Intermediate

## Overview
A systematic approach to validating startup ideas by talking directly to potential customers before writing code. This process helps founders determine if there's genuine demand for their solution and whether they should proceed with building the product.

## When to Use
- You have a startup idea but haven't validated it yet
- You're contemplating leaving your job to start a company
- You've built something but aren't sure if it's the right direction
- You're considering pivoting to a new idea
- You want permission to start customer development before raising money

## Prerequisites
- A general problem area or customer segment you want to explore
- Willingness to overcome social anxiety about talking to strangers
- Time to dedicate 20-30% of your calendar to customer conversations
- Basic understanding of the problem space (or willingness to learn)

## Procedure

### Step 1: Identify Potential Customers
Identify who would actually use or pay for your solution.
- Make a list of 20-30 potential customers or users
- Don't limit yourself to people you already know
- Find people through LinkedIn, industry forums, or direct outreach
- Focus on getting meetings with real decision-makers, not just friendly feedback

### Step 2: Schedule In-Person Meetings
Reach out to schedule physical, face-to-face meetings.
- Aim for in-person meetings whenever possible, not just email surveys
- Target 20-30% of your time on customer meetings (check your calendar)
- Be prepared to feel awkward - "you just got to power through the awkwardness"
- Example outreach: "I'm trying to understand how [problem] works, would you be open to a 30-minute conversation?"

### Step 3: Conduct Customer Conversations
Have substantive conversations, not surface-level validation.
- Show potential customers what you're thinking of building
- Ask about their current solutions and pain points
- Observe their reactions - are they genuinely excited or being polite?
- Take detailed notes on their feedback and concerns
- Get specific about what they currently pay for similar solutions

### Step 4: Pre-Sell Before Building
Attempt to get customers to commit before you write code.
- After discussing the solution, ask: "Would you buy this?"
- Try to get pre-commitments, even if symbolic
- If B2B: "Would your company be interested in being a beta customer?"
- If nobody will commit to trying it, that's valuable negative signal
- Success = at least one person genuinely wants to use what you'll build

### Step 5: Assess Conviction Level
Evaluate whether you have enough signal to proceed.
- Do you have at least ONE customer who would definitely use this?
- Are multiple people expressing the same pain point unprompted?
- Do you feel your conviction growing or shrinking after conversations?
- Did you learn something that changes your understanding of the problem?

### Step 6: Decide to Build or Iterate
Make a clear decision based on your findings.
- Build once you have conviction: "I think I would have a customer. At least one."
- If no conviction: schedule more conversations or explore different angles
- If patterns emerge: adjust your idea based on what you learned
- Document your learnings to guide the first version

## Expected Outcomes
- Clear signal on whether there's demand for your solution
- At least 1-3 customers who are genuinely excited and willing to try your product
- Deep understanding of customer pain points and current solutions
- Either strong conviction to build, or clarity to pivot/stop
- Reduced risk of building something nobody wants

## Common Pitfalls

**Hiding Behind Your Keyboard**
- Problem: Building landing pages and buying ads instead of talking to people
- Why it fails: "A lot of folks' inclination is to build a landing page and buy some Instagram ads... the reason people do that is they're just shy"
- Solution: Force yourself to schedule physical meetings; treat it like exercise - you know you should do it

**Treating Positive Feedback as Validation**
- Problem: People say "that's a great idea!" but won't commit to using it
- Why it fails: Politeness isn't the same as genuine demand
- Solution: Push for commitments, pre-sales, or beta testing agreements

**Not Talking to Enough People**
- Problem: Having 2-3 conversations and thinking that's sufficient
- Why it fails: Small sample size leads to false confidence
- Solution: Aim for 20+ substantive conversations before making major decisions

**Focusing on Fundraising Before Validation**
- Problem: "We're focused on raising our pre-seed round before we talk to customers"
- Why it fails: Investors want to see customer validation, not just ideas
- Solution: Do customer validation first, use it to strengthen fundraising

**Over-Delegating Customer Conversations**
- Problem: Hiring someone else to do customer research for you
- Why it fails: Founders need direct customer insight to build the right thing
- Solution: Founders must personally conduct these conversations, especially early on

## AI Integration Notes

### Context Signals That Should Trigger This SOP
- User mentions having a startup idea but hasn't validated it
- User asks "should I build this?" or "is this a good idea?"
- User is pre-product or very early stage
- User mentions they've been building in isolation without customer input
- User expresses uncertainty about product direction

### How to Adapt for Different Situations
- **B2B Ideas**: Focus on getting meetings with decision-makers, aim for pre-sales conversations
- **Consumer Ideas**: Focus on getting people to use early prototypes, observe behavior not just words
- **Technical Founders**: Emphasize that talking to customers is not optional, even if uncomfortable
- **Former Big Tech Employees**: Remind them this is different from A/B testing at scale

### Limitations and Edge Cases
- Some highly technical ideas (deep tech, research) may require different validation approaches
- Platform/marketplace ideas require validating both sides of the market
- Infrastructure/developer tools can be validated through open source releases
- This process works best when there's a clear customer segment to talk to
- Very novel ideas may require more education before customers understand the value

### Key Phrases to Emphasize
- "Just don't die" - keep the validation process going
- "Am I having fun?" - if customer conversations feel like a drag, reassess
- "At least one customer" - the bar for proceeding is having ONE genuine customer
- "20-30% of your calendar" - concrete metric for sufficient customer engagement
- "Nothing substitutes for actual conversation versus just staring at analytics dashboards"
